In this challenge you will learn everything you need to be a JavaScript programmer, and in general, the whole concept of programming. In the end of the challenge you will get a 30DaysOfJavaScript programming challenge completion certificate. In case you need help or if you would like to help others you may join the telegram group . A 30DaysOfJavaScript challenge is a guide for both beginners and advanced JavaScript developers. Welcome to JavaScript. JavaScript is the language of the web. I enjoy using and teaching JavaScript and I hope you will do so too. In this step by step JavaScript challenge, you will learn JavaScript, the most popular programming language in the history of mankind. JavaScript is used to add interactivity to websites, to develop mobile apps, desktop applications, games and nowadays JavaScript can be used for machine learning and AI . JavaScript (JS) has increased in popularity in recent years and has been the leading programming language for six consecutive years and is the most used programming language on Github. Requirements No prior knowledge of programming is required to follow this challenge. You need only: Motivation A computer Internet A browser A code editor Setup I believe you have the motivation and a strong desire to be a developer, a computer and Internet. If you have those, then you have everything to get started. Install Node.js You may not need Node.js right now but you may need it for later. Install node.js . After downloading double click and install We can check if node is installed on our local machine by opening our device terminal or command prompt. asabeneh $ node -v v12.14.0 When making this tutorial I was using Node version 12.14.0, but now the recommended version of Node.js for download is v14.17.6, by the time you use this material you may have a higher Node.js version. Browser There are many browsers out there. However, I strongly recommend Google Chrome. Installing Google Chrome Install Google Chrome if you do not have one yet. We can write small JavaScript code on the browser console, but we do not use the browser console to develop applications. Opening Google Chrome Console You can open Google Chrome console either by clicking three dots at the top right corner of the browser, selecting More tools -> Developer tools or using a keyboard shortcut. I prefer using shortcuts. To open the Chrome console using a keyboard shortcut. Mac Command+Option+J Windows/Linux: Ctl+Shift+J After you open the Google Chrome console, try to explore the marked buttons. We will spend most of the time on the Console. The Console is the place where your JavaScript code goes. The Google Console V8 engine changes your JavaScript code to machine code. Let us write a JavaScript code on the Google Chrome console: Writing Code on Browser Console We can write any JavaScript code on the Google console or any browser console. However, for this challenge, we only focus on Google Chrome console. Open the console using: Mac Command+Option+I Windows: Ctl+Shift+I Console.log To write our first JavaScript code, we used a built-in function console.log() . We passed an argument as input data, and the function displays the output. We passed 'Hello, World' as input data or argument in the console.log() function. console . log ( 'Hello, World!' ) Console.log with Multiple Arguments The console.log() function can take multiple parameters separated by commas. The syntax looks like as follows: console.log(param1, param2, param3) console . log ( 'Hello' , 'World' , '!' ) console . log ( 'HAPPY' , 'NEW' , 'YEAR' , 2020 ) console . log ( 'Welcome' , 'to' , 30 , 'Days' , 'Of' , 'JavaScript' ) As you can see from the snippet code above, console.log() can take multiple arguments. Congratulations! You wrote your first JavaScript code using console.log() . Comments We can add comments to our code. Comments are very important to make code more readable and to leave remarks in our code. JavaScript does not execute the comment part of our code. In JavaScript, any text line starting with // in JavaScript is a comment, and anything enclosed like this // is also a comment. Example: Single Line Comment // This is the first comment // This is the second comment // I am a single line comment Example: Multiline Comment /* This is a multiline comment Multiline comments can take multiple lines JavaScript is the language of the web */ Syntax Programming languages are similar to human languages. English or many other language uses words, phrases, sentences, compound sentences and other more to convey a meaningful message. The English meaning of syntax is the arrangement of words and phrases to create well-formed sentences in a language . The technical definition of syntax is the structure of statements in a computer language. Programming languages have syntax. JavaScript is a programming language and like other programming languages it has its own syntax. If we do not write a syntax that JavaScript understands, it will raise different types of errors. We will explore different kinds of JavaScript errors later. For now, let us see syntax errors. I made a deliberate mistake. As a result, the console raises syntax errors. Actually, the syntax is very informative. It informs what type of mistake was made. By reading the error feedback guideline, we can correct the syntax and fix the problem. The process of identifying and removing errors from a program is called debugging. Let us fix the errors: console . log ( 'Hello, World!' ) console . log ( 'Hello, World!' ) So far, we saw how to display text using the console.log() . If we are printing text or string using console.log() , the text has to be inside the single quotes, double quotes, or a backtick. Example: console . log ( 'Hello, World!' ) console . log ( \"Hello, World!\" ) console . log ( `Hello, World!` ) Arithmetics Now, let us practice more writing JavaScript codes using console.log() on Google Chrome console for number data types. In addition to the text, we can also do mathematical calculations using JavaScript. Let us do the following simple calculations. It is possible to write JavaScript code on Google Chrome console can directly without the console.log() function. However, it is included in this introduction because most of this challenge would be taking place in a text editor where the usage of the function would be mandatory. You can play around directly with instructions on the console. console . log ( 2 + 3 ) // Addition console . log ( 3 - 2 ) // Subtraction console . log ( 2 * 3 ) // Multiplication console . log ( 3 / 2 ) // Division console . log ( 3 % 2 ) // Modulus - finding remainder console . log ( 3 ** 2 ) // Exponentiation 3 ** 2 == 3 * 3 Code Editor We can write our codes on the browser console, but it won't be for bigger projects. In a real working environment, developers use different code editors to write their codes. In this 30 days of JavaScript challenge, we will be using Visual Studio Code. Installing Visual Studio Code Visual Studio Code is a very popular open-source text editor. I would recommend to download Visual Studio Code , but if you are in favor of other editors, feel free to follow with what you have. If you installed Visual Studio Code, let us start using it. How to Use Visual Studio Code Open the Visual Studio Code by double-clicking its icon. When you open it, you will get this kind of interface. Try to interact with the labeled icons. Adding JavaScript to a Web Page JavaScript can be added to a web page in three different ways: Inline script Internal script External script Multiple External scripts The following sections show different ways of adding JavaScript code to your web page. Inline Script Create a project folder on your desktop or in any location, name it 30DaysOfJS and create an index.html file in the project folder. Then paste the following code and open it in a browser, for example Chrome . <!DOCTYPE html> < html lang = \"en\" > < head > < title > 30DaysOfScript:Inline Script </ title > </ head > < body > < button onclick = \"alert('Welcome to 30DaysOfJavaScript!')\" > Click Me </ button > </ body > </ html > Now, you just wrote your first inline script. We can create a pop up alert message using the alert() built-in function. Internal Script The internal script can be written in the head or the body , but it is preferred to put it on the body of the HTML document. First, let us write on the head part of the page. <!DOCTYPE html> < html lang = \"en\" > < head > < title > 30DaysOfScript:Internal Script </ title > < script > console . log ( 'Welcome to 30DaysOfJavaScript' ) </ script > </ head > < body ></ body > </ html > This is how we write an internal script most of the time. Writing the JavaScript code in the body section is the most preferred option. Open the browser console to see the output from the console.log() . <!DOCTYPE html> < html lang = \"en\" > < head > < title > 30DaysOfScript:Internal Script </ title > </ head > < body > < button onclick = \"alert('Welcome to 30DaysOfJavaScript!');\" > Click Me </ button > < script > console . log ( 'Welcome to 30DaysOfJavaScript' ) </ script > </ body > </ html > Open the browser console to see the output from the console.log() . External Script Similar to the internal script, the external script link can be on the header or body, but it is preferred to put it in the body. First, we should create an external JavaScript file with .js extension. All files ending with .js extension are JavaScript files. Create a file named introduction.js inside your project directory and write the following code and link this .js file at the bottom of the body. console . log ( 'Welcome to 30DaysOfJavaScript' ) External scripts in the head : <!DOCTYPE html> < html lang = \"en\" > < head > < title > 30DaysOfJavaScript:External script </ title > < script src = \"introduction.js\" ></ script > </ head > < body ></ body > </ html > External scripts in the body : <!DOCTYPE html> < html lang = \"en\" > < head > < title > 30DaysOfJavaScript:External script </ title > </ head > < body > <!-- JavaScript external link could be in the header or in the body --> <!-- Before the closing tag of the body is the recommended place to put the external JavaScript script --> < script src = \"introduction.js\" ></ script > </ body > </ html > Open the browser console to see the output of the console.log() . Multiple External Scripts We can also link multiple external JavaScript files to a web page. Create a helloworld.js file inside the 30DaysOfJS folder and write the following code. console . log ( 'Hello, World!' ) <!DOCTYPE html> < html lang = \"en\" > < head > < title > Multiple External Scripts </ title > </ head > < body > < script src = \"./helloworld.js\" ></ script > < script src = \"./introduction.js\" ></ script > </ body > </ html > Your main.js file should be below all other scripts . It is very important to remember this. Introduction to Data types In JavaScript and also other programming languages, there are different types of data types. The following are JavaScript primitive data types: String, Number, Boolean, undefined, Null , and Symbol . Numbers Integers: Integer (negative, zero and positive) numbers Example: ... -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3 ... Float-point numbers: Decimal number Example ... -3.5, -2.25, -1.0, 0.0, 1.1, 2.2, 3.5 ... Strings A collection of one or more characters between two single quotes, double quotes, or backticks. Example: 'a' 'Asabeneh' \"Asabeneh\" 'Finland' 'JavaScript is a beautiful programming language' 'I love teaching' 'I hope you are enjoying the first day' `We can also create a string using a backtick` 'A string could be just as small as one character or as big as many pages' 'Any data type under a single quote, double quote or backtick is a string' Booleans A boolean value is either True or False. Any comparisons returns a boolean value, which is either true or false. A boolean data type is either a true or false value. Example: true // if the light is on, the value is true false // if the light is off, the value is false Undefined In JavaScript, if we don't assign a value to a variable, the value is undefined. In addition to that, if a function is not returning anything, it returns undefined. let firstName console . log ( firstName ) // undefined, because it is not assigned to a value yet Null Null in JavaScript means an empty value. let emptyValue = null Checking Data Types To check the data type of a certain variable, we use the typeof operator. See the following example. console . log ( typeof 'Asabeneh' ) // string console . log ( typeof 5 ) // number console . log ( typeof true ) // boolean console . log ( typeof null ) // object type console . log ( typeof undefined ) // undefined Comments Again Remember that commenting in JavaScript is similar to other programming languages. Comments are important in making your code more readable. There are two ways of commenting: Single line commenting Multiline commenting // commenting the code itself with a single comment // let firstName = 'Asabeneh'; single line comment // let lastName = 'Yetayeh'; single line comment Multiline commenting: /* let location = 'Helsinki'; let age = 100; let isMarried = true; This is a Multiple line comment */ Variables Variables are containers of data. Variables are used to store data in a memory location. When a variable is declared, a memory location is reserved. When a variable is assigned to a value (data), the memory space will be filled with that data. To declare a variable, we use var , let , or const keywords. For a variable that changes at a different time, we use let . If the data does not change at all, we use const . For example, PI, country name, gravity do not change, and we can use const . We will not use var in this challenge and I don't recommend you to use it. It is error prone way of declaring variable it has lots of leak. We will talk more about var, let, and const in detail in other sections (scope). For now, the above explanation is enough. A valid JavaScript variable name must follow the following rules: A JavaScript variable name should not begin with a number. A JavaScript variable name does not allow special characters except dollar sign and underscore. A JavaScript variable name follows a camelCase convention. A JavaScript variable name should not have space between words. The following are examples of valid JavaScript variables. firstName lastName country city capitalCity age isMarried first_name last_name is_married capital_city num1 num_1 _num_1 $num1 year2020 year_2020 The first and second variables on the list follows the camelCase convention of declaring in JavaScript. In this material, we will use camelCase variables(camelWithOneHump). We use CamelCase(CamelWithTwoHump) to declare classes, we will discuss about classes and objects in other section. Example of invalid variables: first - name 1 _num num_ # _1 Let us declare variables with different data types. To declare a variable, we need to use let or const keyword before the variable name. Following the variable name, we write an equal sign (assignment operator), and a value(assigned data). // Syntax let nameOfVariable = value The nameOfVriable is the name that stores different data of value. See below for detail examples. Examples of declared variables // Declaring different variables of different data types let firstName = 'Asabeneh' // first name of a person let lastName = 'Yetayeh' // last name of a person let country = 'Finland' // country let city = 'Helsinki' // capital city let age = 100 // age in years let isMarried = true console . log ( firstName , lastName , country , city , age , isMarried ) Asabeneh Yetayeh Finland Helsinki 100 true // Declaring variables with number values let age = 100 // age in years const gravity = 9.81 // earth gravity in m/s2 const boilingPoint = 100 // water boiling point, temperature in \u00b0C const PI = 3.14 // geometrical constant console . log ( gravity , boilingPoint , PI ) 9 .81 100 3 .14 // Variables can also be declaring in one line separated by comma, however I recommend to use a seperate line to make code more readble let name = 'Asabeneh' , job = 'teacher' , live = 'Finland' console . log ( name , job , live ) Asabeneh teacher Finland When you run index.html file in the 01-Day folder you should get this: \ud83c\udf15 You are amazing!

Variables are used to store data in a memory location. When a variable is declared, a memory location is reserved. When a variable is assigned to a value (data), the memory space will be filled with that data. To declare a variable, we use var , let , or const keywords. For a variable that changes at a different time, we use let . If the data does not change at all, we use const . For example, PI, country name, gravity do not change, and we can use const . We will not use var in this challenge and I don't recommend you to use it. It is error prone way of declaring variable it has lots of leak. We will talk more about var, let, and const in detail in other sections (scope). For now, the above explanation is enough. A valid JavaScript variable name must follow the following rules: A JavaScript variable name should not begin with a number. A JavaScript variable name does not allow special characters except dollar sign and underscore. A JavaScript variable name follows a camelCase convention. A JavaScript variable name should not have space between words. The following are examples of valid JavaScript variables. firstName lastName country city capitalCity age isMarried first_name last_name is_married capital_city num1 num_1 _num_1 $num1 year2020 year_2020 The first and second variables on the list follows the camelCase convention of declaring in JavaScript. In this material, we will use camelCase variables(camelWithOneHump). We use CamelCase(CamelWithTwoHump) to declare classes, we will discuss about classes and objects in other section. Example of invalid variables: first - name 1 _num num_ # _1 Let us declare variables with different data types. To declare a variable, we need to use let or const keyword before the variable name. Following the variable name, we write an equal sign (assignment operator), and a value(assigned data). // Syntax let nameOfVariable = value The nameOfVriable is the name that stores different data of value. See below for detail examples. Examples of declared variables // Declaring different variables of different data types let firstName = 'Asabeneh' // first name of a person let lastName = 'Yetayeh' // last name of a person let country = 'Finland' // country let city = 'Helsinki' // capital city let age = 100 // age in years let isMarried = true console . log ( firstName , lastName , country , city , age , isMarried ) Asabeneh Yetayeh Finland Helsinki 100 true // Declaring variables with number values let age = 100 // age in years const gravity = 9.81 // earth gravity in m/s2 const boilingPoint = 100 // water boiling point, temperature in \u00b0C const PI = 3.14 // geometrical constant console . log ( gravity , boilingPoint , PI ) 9 .81 100 3 .14 // Variables can also be declaring in one line separated by comma, however I recommend to use a seperate line to make code more readble let name = 'Asabeneh' , job = 'teacher' , live = 'Finland' console . log ( name , job , live ) Asabeneh teacher Finland When you run index.html file in the 01-Day folder you should get this: \ud83c\udf15 You are amazing!

Data or values have data types. Data types describe the characteristics of data. Data types can be divided into two: Primitive data types Non-primitive data types(Object References) Primitive Data Types Primitive data types in JavaScript include: Numbers - Integers, floats Strings - Any data under single quote, double quote or backtick quote Booleans - true or false value Null - empty value or no value Undefined - a declared variable without a value Symbol - A unique value that can be generated by Symbol constructor Non-primitive data types in JavaScript includes: Objects Arrays Now, let us see what exactly primitive and non-primitive data types mean. Primitive data types are immutable(non-modifiable) data types. Once a primitive data type is created we cannot modify it. Example: let word = 'JavaScript' If we try to modify the string stored in variable word , JavaScript should raise an error. Any data type under a single quote, double quote, or backtick quote is a string data type. word [ 0 ] = 'Y' This expression does not change the string stored in the variable word . So, we can say that strings are not modifiable or in other words immutable. Primitive data types are compared by its values. Let us compare different data values. See the example below: let numOne = 3 let numTwo = 3 console . log ( numOne == numTwo ) // true let js = 'JavaScript' let py = 'Python' console . log ( js == py ) //false let lightOn = true let lightOff = false console . log ( lightOn == lightOff ) // false Non-Primitive Data Types Non-primitive data types are modifiable or mutable. We can modify the value of non-primitive data types after it gets created. Let us see by creating an array. An array is a list of data values in a square bracket. Arrays can contain the same or different data types. Array values are referenced by their index. In JavaScript array index starts at zero. I.e., the first element of an array is found at index zero, the second element at index one, and the third element at index two, etc. let nums = [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] nums [ 0 ] = 10 console . log ( nums ) // [10, 2, 3] As you can see, an array, which is a non-primitive data type is mutable. Non-primitive data types cannot be compared by value. Even if two non-primitive data types have the same properties and values, they are not strictly equal. let nums = [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] let numbers = [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] console . log ( nums == numbers ) // false let userOne = { name : 'Asabeneh' , role : 'teaching' , country : 'Finland' } let userTwo = { name : 'Asabeneh' , role : 'teaching' , country : 'Finland' } console . log ( userOne == userTwo ) // false Rule of thumb, we do not compare non-primitive data types. Do not compare arrays, functions, or objects. Non-primitive values are referred to as reference types, because they are being compared by reference instead of value. Two objects are only strictly equal if they refer to the same underlying object. let nums = [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] let numbers = nums console . log ( nums == numbers ) // true let userOne = { name : 'Asabeneh' , role : 'teaching' , country : 'Finland' } let userTwo = userOne console . log ( userOne == userTwo ) // true If you have a hard time understanding the difference between primitive data types and non-primitive data types, you are not the only one. Calm down and just go to the next section and try to come back after some time. Now let us start the data types by number type. Numbers Numbers are integers and decimal values which can do all the arithmetic operations. Let's see some examples of Numbers. Declaring Number Data Types let age = 35 const gravity = 9.81 // we use const for non-changing values, gravitational constant in m/s2 let mass = 72 // mass in Kilogram const PI = 3.14 // pi a geometrical constant // More Examples const boilingPoint = 100 // temperature in oC, boiling point of water which is a constant const bodyTemp = 37 // oC average human body temperature, which is a constant console . log ( age , gravity , mass , PI , boilingPoint , bodyTemp ) Math Object In JavaScript the Math Object provides a lots of methods to work with numbers. const PI = Math . PI console . log ( PI ) // 3.141592653589793 // Rounding to the closest number // if above .5 up if less 0.5 down rounding console . log ( Math . round ( PI )) // 3 to round values to the nearest number console . log ( Math . round ( 9.81 )) // 10 console . log ( Math . floor ( PI )) // 3 rounding down console . log ( Math . ceil ( PI )) // 4 rounding up console . log ( Math . min ( - 5 , 3 , 20 , 4 , 5 , 10 )) // -5, returns the minimum value console . log ( Math . max ( - 5 , 3 , 20 , 4 , 5 , 10 )) // 20, returns the maximum value const randNum = Math . random () // creates random number between 0 to 0.999999 console . log ( randNum ) // Let us create random number between 0 to 10 const num = Math . floor ( Math . random () * 11 ) // creates random number between 0 and 10 console . log ( num ) //Absolute value console . log ( Math . abs ( - 10 )) // 10 //Square root console . log ( Math . sqrt ( 100 )) // 10 console . log ( Math . sqrt ( 2 )) // 1.4142135623730951 // Power console . log ( Math . pow ( 3 , 2 )) // 9 console . log ( Math . E ) // 2.718 // Logarithm // Returns the natural logarithm with base E of x, Math.log(x) console . log ( Math . log ( 2 )) // 0.6931471805599453 console . log ( Math . log ( 10 )) // 2.302585092994046 // Returns the natural logarithm of 2 and 10 respectively console . log ( Math . LN2 ) // 0.6931471805599453 console . log ( Math . LN10 ) // 2.302585092994046 // Trigonometry Math . sin ( 0 ) Math . sin ( 60 ) Math . cos ( 0 ) Math . cos ( 60 ) Random Number Generator The JavaScript Math Object has a random() method number generator which generates number from 0 to 0.999999999... let randomNum = Math . random () // generates 0 to 0.999... Now, let us see how we can use random() method to generate a random number between 0 and 10: let randomNum = Math . random () // generates 0 to 0.999 let numBtnZeroAndTen = randomNum * 11 console . log ( numBtnZeroAndTen ) // this gives: min 0 and max 10.99 let randomNumRoundToFloor = Math . floor ( numBtnZeroAndTen ) console . log ( randomNumRoundToFloor ) // this gives between 0 and 10 Strings Strings are texts, which are under single , double , back-tick quote. To declare a string, we need a variable name, assignment operator, a value under a single quote, double quote, or backtick quote. Let's see some examples of strings: let space = ' ' // an empty space string let firstName = 'Asabeneh' let lastName = 'Yetayeh' let country = 'Finland' let city = 'Helsinki' let language = 'JavaScript' let job = 'teacher' let quote = \"The saying,'Seeing is Believing' is not correct in 2020.\" let quotWithBackTick = `The saying,'Seeing is Believing' is not correct in 2020.` String Concatenation Connecting two or more strings together is called concatenation. Using the strings declared in the previous String section: let fullName = firstName + space + lastName ; // concatenation, merging two string together. console . log ( fullName ); Asabeneh Yetayeh We can concatenate strings in different ways. Concatenating Using Addition Operator Concatenating using the addition operator is an old way. This way of concatenating is tedious and error-prone. It is good to know how to concatenate this way, but I strongly suggest to use the ES6 template strings (explained later on). // Declaring different variables of different data types let space = ' ' let firstName = 'Asabeneh' let lastName = 'Yetayeh' let country = 'Finland' let city = 'Helsinki' let language = 'JavaScript' let job = 'teacher' let age = 250 let fullName = firstName + space + lastName let personInfoOne = fullName + '. I am ' + age + '. I live in ' + country ; // ES5 string addition console . log ( personInfoOne ) Asabeneh Yetayeh. I am 250 . I live in Finland Long Literal Strings A string could be a single character or paragraph or a page. If the string length is too big it does not fit in one line. We can use the backslash character (\\) at the end of each line to indicate that the string will continue on the next line. Example: const paragraph = \"My name is Asabeneh Yetayeh. I live in Finland, Helsinki.\\ I am a teacher and I love teaching. I teach HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Redux, \\ Node.js, Python, Data Analysis and D3.js for anyone who is interested to learn. \\ In the end of 2019, I was thinking to expand my teaching and to reach \\ to global audience and I started a Python challenge from November 20 - December 19.\\ It was one of the most rewarding and inspiring experience.\\ Now, we are in 2020. I am enjoying preparing the 30DaysOfJavaScript challenge and \\ I hope you are enjoying too.\" console . log ( paragraph ) Escape Sequences in Strings In JavaScript and other programming languages \\ followed by some characters is an escape sequence. Let's see the most common escape characters: \\n: new line \\t: Tab, means 8 spaces \\\\: Back slash \\': Single quote (') \\\": Double quote (\") console . log ( 'I hope everyone is enjoying the 30 Days Of JavaScript challenge.\\nDo you ?' ) // line break console . log ( 'Days\\tTopics\\tExercises' ) console . log ( 'Day 1\\t3\\t5' ) console . log ( 'Day 2\\t3\\t5' ) console . log ( 'Day 3\\t3\\t5' ) console . log ( 'Day 4\\t3\\t5' ) console . log ( 'This is a backslash symbol (\\\\)' ) // To write a backslash console . log ( 'In every programming language it starts with \\\"Hello, World!\\\"' ) console . log ( \"In every programming language it starts with \\'Hello, World!\\'\" ) console . log ( 'The saying \\'Seeing is Believing\\' isn\\'t correct in 2020' ) Output in console: I hope everyone is enjoying the 30 Days Of JavaScript challenge. Do you ? Days Topics Exercises Day 1 3 5 Day 2 3 5 Day 3 3 5 Day 4 3 5 This is a backslash symbol ( \\) In every programming language it starts with \"Hello, World!\" In every programming language it starts with 'Hello, World!' The saying 'Seeing is Believing' isn ' t correct in 2020 Template Literals (Template Strings) To create a template strings, we use two back-ticks. We can inject data as expressions inside a template string. To inject data, we enclose the expression with a curly bracket({}) preceded by a $ sign. See the syntax below. //Syntax `String literal text` `String literal text ${ expression } ` Example: 1 console . log ( `The sum of 2 and 3 is 5` ) // statically writing the data let a = 2 let b = 3 console . log ( `The sum of ${ a } and ${ b } is ${ a + b } ` ) // injecting the data dynamically Example:2 let firstName = 'Asabeneh' let lastName = 'Yetayeh' let country = 'Finland' let city = 'Helsinki' let language = 'JavaScript' let job = 'teacher' let age = 250 let fullName = firstName + ' ' + lastName let personInfoTwo = `I am ${ fullName } . I am ${ age } . I live in ${ country } .` //ES6 - String interpolation method let personInfoThree = `I am ${ fullName } . I live in ${ city } , ${ country } . I am a ${ job } . I teach ${ language } .` console . log ( personInfoTwo ) console . log ( personInfoThree ) I am Asabeneh Yetayeh. I am 250 . I live in Finland. I am Asabeneh Yetayeh. I live in Helsinki, Finland. I am a teacher. I teach JavaScript. Using a string template or string interpolation method, we can add expressions, which could be a value, or some operations (comparison, arithmetic operations, ternary operation). let a = 2 let b = 3 console . log ( ` ${ a } is greater than ${ b } : ${ a > b } ` ) 2 is greater than 3 : false String Methods Everything in JavaScript is an object. A string is a primitive data type that means we can not modify it once it is created. The string object has many string methods. There are different string methods that can help us to work with strings. length : The string length method returns the number of characters in a string included empty space. Example: let js = 'JavaScript' console . log ( js . length ) // 10 let firstName = 'Asabeneh' console . log ( firstName . length ) // 8 Accessing characters in a string : We can access each character in a string using its index. In programming, counting starts from 0. The first index of the string is zero, and the last index is the length of the string minus one. Let us access different characters in 'JavaScript' string. let string = 'JavaScript' let firstLetter = string [ 0 ] console . log ( firstLetter ) // J let secondLetter = string [ 1 ] // a let thirdLetter = string [ 2 ] let lastLetter = string [ 9 ] console . log ( lastLetter ) // t let lastIndex = string . length - 1 console . log ( lastIndex ) // 9 console . log ( string [ lastIndex ]) // t toUpperCase() : this method changes the string to uppercase letters. let string = 'JavaScript' console . log ( string . toUpperCase ()) // JAVASCRIPT let firstName = 'Asabeneh' console . log ( firstName . toUpperCase ()) // ASABENEH let country = 'Finland' console . log ( country . toUpperCase ()) // FINLAND toLowerCase() : this method changes the string to lowercase letters. let string = 'JavasCript' console . log ( string . toLowerCase ()) // javascript let firstName = 'Asabeneh' console . log ( firstName . toLowerCase ()) // asabeneh let country = 'Finland' console . log ( country . toLowerCase ()) // finland substr() : It takes two arguments, the starting index and number of characters to slice. let string = 'JavaScript' console . log ( string . substr ( 4 , 6 )) // Script let country = 'Finland' console . log ( country . substr ( 3 , 4 )) // land substring() : It takes two arguments, the starting index and the stopping index but it doesn't include the character at the stopping index. let string = 'JavaScript' console . log ( string . substring ( 0 , 4 )) // Java console . log ( string . substring ( 4 , 10 )) // Script console . log ( string . substring ( 4 )) // Script let country = 'Finland' console . log ( country . substring ( 0 , 3 )) // Fin console . log ( country . substring ( 3 , 7 )) // land console . log ( country . substring ( 3 )) // land split() : The split method splits a string at a specified place. let string = '30 Days Of JavaScript' console . log ( string . split ()) // Changes to an array -> [\"30 Days Of JavaScript\"] console . log ( string . split ( ' ' )) // Split to an array at space -> [\"30\", \"Days\", \"Of\", \"JavaScript\"] let firstName = 'Asabeneh' console . log ( firstName . split ()) // Change to an array - > [\"Asabeneh\"] console . log ( firstName . split ( '' )) // Split to an array at each letter -> [\"A\", \"s\", \"a\", \"b\", \"e\", \"n\", \"e\", \"h\"] let countries = 'Finland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Iceland' console . log ( countries . split ( ',' )) // split to any array at comma -> [\"Finland\", \" Sweden\", \" Norway\", \" Denmark\", \" and Iceland\"] console . log ( countries . split ( ', ' )) // [\"Finland\", \"Sweden\", \"Norway\", \"Denmark\", \"and Iceland\"] trim() : Removes trailing space in the beginning or the end of a string. let string = ' 30 Days Of JavaScript ' console . log ( string ) console . log ( string . trim ( ' ' )) let firstName = ' Asabeneh ' console . log ( firstName ) console . log ( firstName . trim ()) // still removes spaces at the beginning and the end of the string 30 Days Of JavasCript 30 Days Of JavasCript Asabeneh Asabeneh includes() : It takes a substring argument and it checks if substring argument exists in the string. includes() returns a boolean. If a substring exist in a string, it returns true, otherwise it returns false. let string = '30 Days Of JavaScript' console . log ( string . includes ( 'Days' )) // true console . log ( string . includes ( 'days' )) // false - it is case sensitive! console . log ( string . includes ( 'Script' )) // true console . log ( string . includes ( 'script' )) // false console . log ( string . includes ( 'java' )) // false console . log ( string . includes ( 'Java' )) // true let country = 'Finland' console . log ( country . includes ( 'fin' )) // false console . log ( country . includes ( 'Fin' )) // true console . log ( country . includes ( 'land' )) // true console . log ( country . includes ( 'Land' )) // false replace() : takes as a parameter the old substring and a new substring. string . replace ( oldsubstring , newsubstring ) let string = '30 Days Of JavaScript' console . log ( string . replace ( 'JavaScript' , 'Python' )) // 30 Days Of Python let country = 'Finland' console . log ( country . replace ( 'Fin' , 'Noman' )) // Nomanland charAt() : Takes index and it returns the value at that index string . charAt ( index ) let string = '30 Days Of JavaScript' console . log ( string . charAt ( 0 )) // 3 let lastIndex = string . length - 1 console . log ( string . charAt ( lastIndex )) // t charCodeAt() : Takes index and it returns char code (ASCII number) of the value at that index string . charCodeAt ( index ) let string = '30 Days Of JavaScript' console . log ( string . charCodeAt ( 3 )) // D ASCII number is 68 let lastIndex = string . length - 1 console . log ( string . charCodeAt ( lastIndex )) // t ASCII is 116 indexOf() : Takes a substring and if the substring exists in a string it returns the first position of the substring if does not exist it returns -1 string . indexOf ( substring ) let string = '30 Days Of JavaScript' console . log ( string . indexOf ( 'D' )) // 3 console . log ( string . indexOf ( 'Days' )) // 3 console . log ( string . indexOf ( 'days' )) // -1 console . log ( string . indexOf ( 'a' )) // 4 console . log ( string . indexOf ( 'JavaScript' )) // 11 console . log ( string . indexOf ( 'Script' )) //15 console . log ( string . indexOf ( 'script' )) // -1 lastIndexOf() : Takes a substring and if the substring exists in a string it returns the last position of the substring if it does not exist it returns -1 //syntax string . lastIndexOf ( substring ) let string = 'I love JavaScript.

Example: // Different javascript data types // Let's declare different data types let firstName = 'Asabeneh' // string let lastName = 'Yetayeh' // string let country = 'Finland' // string let city = 'Helsinki' // string let age = 250 // number, it is not my real age, do not worry about it let job // undefined, because a value was not assigned console . log ( typeof 'Asabeneh' ) // string console . log ( typeof firstName ) // string console . log ( typeof 10 ) // number console . log ( typeof 3.14 ) // number console . log ( typeof true ) // boolean console . log ( typeof false ) // boolean console . log ( typeof NaN ) // number console . log ( typeof job ) // undefined console . log ( typeof undefined ) // undefined console . log ( typeof null ) // object Changing Data Type (Casting) Casting: Converting one data type to another data type. We use parseInt() , parseFloat() , Number() , + sign , str() When we do arithmetic operations string numbers should be first converted to integer or float if not it returns an error. String to Int We can convert string number to a number. Any number inside a quote is a string number. An example of a string number: '10', '5', etc. We can convert string to number using the following methods: parseInt() Number() Plus sign(+) let num = '10' let numInt = parseInt ( num ) console . log ( numInt ) // 10 let num = '10' let numInt = Number ( num ) console . log ( numInt ) // 10 let num = '10' let numInt = + num console . log ( numInt ) // 10 String to Float We can convert string float number to a float number. Any float number inside a quote is a string float number. An example of a string float number: '9.81', '3.14', '1.44', etc. We can convert string float to number using the following methods: parseFloat() Number() Plus sign(+) let num = '9.81' let numFloat = parseFloat ( num ) console . log ( numFloat ) // 9.81 let num = '9.81' let numFloat = Number ( num ) console . log ( numFloat ) // 9.81 let num = '9.81' let numFloat = + num console . log ( numFloat ) // 9.81 Float to Int We can convert float numbers to integers.

Data or values have data types. Data types describe the characteristics of data.

Primitive data types are immutable(non-modifiable) data types. Once a primitive data type is created we cannot modify it. Example: let word = 'JavaScript' If we try to modify the string stored in variable word , JavaScript should raise an error. Any data type under a single quote, double quote, or backtick quote is a string data type. word [ 0 ] = 'Y' This expression does not change the string stored in the variable word . So, we can say that strings are not modifiable or in other words immutable. Primitive data types are compared by its values. Let us compare different data values. See the example below: let numOne = 3 let numTwo = 3 console . log ( numOne == numTwo ) // true let js = 'JavaScript' let py = 'Python' console . log ( js == py ) //false let lightOn = true let lightOff = false console . log ( lightOn == lightOff ) // false","title":"Primitive Data Types"},{"location":"02-day/#non-primitive-data-types","text":"Non-primitive data types are modifiable or mutable. We can modify the value of non-primitive data types after it gets created. Let us see by creating an array. An array is a list of data values in a square bracket. Arrays can contain the same or different data types. Array values are referenced by their index. In JavaScript array index starts at zero. I.e., the first element of an array is found at index zero, the second element at index one, and the third element at index two, etc. let nums = [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] nums [ 0 ] = 10 console . log ( nums ) // [10, 2, 3] As you can see, an array, which is a non-primitive data type is mutable. Non-primitive data types cannot be compared by value. Even if two non-primitive data types have the same properties and values, they are not strictly equal. let nums = [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] let numbers = [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] console . log ( nums == numbers ) // false let userOne = { name : 'Asabeneh' , role : 'teaching' , country : 'Finland' } let userTwo = { name : 'Asabeneh' , role : 'teaching' , country : 'Finland' } console . log ( userOne == userTwo ) // false Rule of thumb, we do not compare non-primitive data types. Do not compare arrays, functions, or objects. Non-primitive values are referred to as reference types, because they are being compared by reference instead of value. Two objects are only strictly equal if they refer to the same underlying object. let nums = [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] let numbers = nums console . log ( nums == numbers ) // true let userOne = { name : 'Asabeneh' , role : 'teaching' , country : 'Finland' } let userTwo = userOne console . log ( userOne == userTwo ) // true If you have a hard time understanding the difference between primitive data types and non-primitive data types, you are not the only one.

Boolean value is either true or false. The use of these data types will be clear when you start the comparison operator. Any comparisons return a boolean value which is either true or false. Example: Boolean Values let isLightOn = true let isRaining = false let isHungry = false let isMarried = true let truValue = 4 > 3 // true let falseValue = 4 < 3 // false We agreed that boolean values are either true or false. Truthy values All numbers(positive and negative) are truthy except zero All strings are truthy except an empty string ('') The boolean true Falsy values 0 0n null undefined NaN the boolean false '', \"\", ``, empty string It is good to remember those truthy values and falsy values. In later section, we will use them with conditions to make decisions. Undefined If we declare a variable and if we do not assign a value, the value will be undefined. In addition to this, if a function is not returning the value, it will be undefined. let firstName console . log ( firstName ) //not defined, because it is not assigned to a value yet Null let empty = null console . log ( empty ) // -> null , means no value Operators Assignment operators An equal sign in JavaScript is an assignment operator. It uses to assign a variable. let firstName = 'Asabeneh' let country = 'Finland' Assignment Operators Arithmetic Operators Arithmetic operators are mathematical operators. Addition(+): a + b Subtraction(-): a - b Multiplication(*): a * b Division(/): a / b Modulus(%): a % b Exponential( ): a b let numOne = 4 let numTwo = 3 let sum = numOne + numTwo let diff = numOne - numTwo let mult = numOne * numTwo let div = numOne / numTwo let remainder = numOne % numTwo let powerOf = numOne ** numTwo console . log ( sum , diff , mult , div , remainder , powerOf ) // 7,1,12,1.33,1, 64 const PI = 3.14 let radius = 100 // length in meter //Let us calculate area of a circle const areaOfCircle = PI * radius * radius console . log ( areaOfCircle ) // 314 m const gravity = 9.81 // in m/s2 let mass = 72 // in Kilogram // Let us calculate weight of an object const weight = mass * gravity console . log ( weight ) // 706.32 N(Newton) const boilingPoint = 100 // temperature in oC, boiling point of water const bodyTemp = 37 // body temperature in oC // Concatenating string with numbers using string interpolation /* The boiling point of water is 100 oC. Human body temperature is 37 oC. The gravity of earth is 9.81 m/s2. */ console . log ( `The boiling point of water is ${ boilingPoint } oC.\\nHuman body temperature is ${ bodyTemp } oC.\\nThe gravity of earth is ${ gravity } m / s2.` ) Comparison Operators In programming we compare values, we use comparison operators to compare two values. We check if a value is greater or less or equal to other value. Example: Comparison Operators console . log ( 3 > 2 ) // true, because 3 is greater than 2 console . log ( 3 >= 2 ) // true, because 3 is greater than 2 console . log ( 3 < 2 ) // false, because 3 is greater than 2 console . log ( 2 < 3 ) // true, because 2 is less than 3 console . log ( 2 <= 3 ) // true, because 2 is less than 3 console . log ( 3 == 2 ) // false, because 3 is not equal to 2 console . log ( 3 != 2 ) // true, because 3 is not equal to 2 console . log ( 3 == '3' ) // true, compare only value console . log ( 3 === '3' ) // false, compare both value and data type console . log ( 3 !== '3' ) // true, compare both value and data type console . log ( 3 != 3 ) // false, compare only value console . log ( 3 !== 3 ) // false, compare both value and data type console . log ( 0 == false ) // true, equivalent console . log ( 0 === false ) // false, not exactly the same console . log ( 0 == '' ) // true, equivalent console . log ( 0 == ' ' ) // true, equivalent console . log ( 0 === '' ) // false, not exactly the same console . log ( 1 == true ) // true, equivalent console . log ( 1 === true ) // false, not exactly the same console . log ( undefined == null ) // true console . log ( undefined === null ) // false console . log ( NaN == NaN ) // false, not equal console . log ( NaN === NaN ) // false console . log ( typeof NaN ) // number console . log ( 'mango' . length == 'avocado' . length ) // false console . log ( 'mango' . length != 'avocado' . length ) // true console . log ( 'mango' . length < 'avocado' . length ) // true console . log ( 'milk' . length == 'meat' . length ) // true console . log ( 'milk' . length != 'meat' . length ) // false console . log ( 'tomato' . length == 'potato' . length ) // true console . log ( 'python' . length > 'dragon' . length ) // false Try to understand the above comparisons with some logic. Remembering without any logic might be difficult. JavaScript is somehow a wired kind of programming language. JavaScript code run and give you a result but unless you are good at it may not be the desired result. As rule of thumb, if a value is not true with == it will not be equal with ===. Using === is safer than using ==. The following link has an exhaustive list of comparison of data types. Logical Operators The following symbols are the common logical operators: &&(ampersand) , ||(pipe) and !(negation). The && operator gets true only if the two operands are true. The || operator gets true either of the operand is true. The ! operator negates true to false and false to true. // && ampersand operator example const check = 4 > 3 && 10 > 5 // true && true -> true const check = 4 > 3 && 10 < 5 // true && false -> false const check = 4 < 3 && 10 < 5 // false && false -> false // || pipe or operator, example const check = 4 > 3 || 10 > 5 // true || true -> true const check = 4 > 3 || 10 < 5 // true || false -> true const check = 4 < 3 || 10 < 5 // false || false -> false //! Negation examples let check = 4 > 3 // true let check = ! ( 4 > 3 ) // false let isLightOn = true let isLightOff = ! isLightOn // false let isMarried = ! false // true Increment Operator In JavaScript we use the increment operator to increase a value stored in a variable. The increment could be pre or post increment. Let us see each of them: Pre-increment let count = 0 console . log ( ++ count ) // 1 console . log ( count ) // 1 Post-increment let count = 0 console . log ( count ++ ) // 0 console . log ( count ) // 1 We use most of the time post-increment. At least you should remember how to use post-increment operator. Decrement Operator In JavaScript we use the decrement operator to decrease a value stored in a variable. The decrement could be pre or post decrement. Let us see each of them: Pre-decrement let count = 0 console . log ( -- count ) // -1 console . log ( count ) // -1 Post-decrement let count = 0 console . log ( count -- ) // 0 console . log ( count ) // -1 Ternary Operators Ternary operator allows to write a condition. Another way to write conditionals is using ternary operators. Look at the following examples: let isRaining = true isRaining ? console . log ( 'You need a rain coat.' ) : console . log ( 'No need for a rain coat.' ) isRaining = false isRaining ? console . log ( 'You need a rain coat.' ) : console . log ( 'No need for a rain coat.' ) You need a rain coat. No need for a rain coat. let number = 5 number > 0 ? console . log ( ` ${ number } is a positive number` ) : console . log ( ` ${ number } is a negative number` ) number = - 5 number > 0 ? console . log ( ` ${ number } is a positive number` ) : console . log ( ` ${ number } is a negative number` ) 5 is a positive number -5 is a negative number Operator Precedence I would like to recommend you to read about operator precedence from this link Window Methods Window alert() method As you have seen at very beginning alert() method displays an alert box with a specified message and an OK button. It is a builtin method and it takes on argument. alert ( message ) alert ( 'Welcome to 30DaysOfJavaScript' ) Do not use too much alert because it is destructing and annoying, use it just to test. Window prompt() method The window prompt methods display a prompt box with an input on your browser to take input values and the input data can be stored in a variable. The prompt() method takes two arguments. The second argument is optional. prompt ( 'required text' , 'optional text' ) let number = prompt ( 'Enter number' , 'number goes here' ) console . log ( number ) Window confirm() method The confirm() method displays a dialog box with a specified message, along with an OK and a Cancel button. A confirm box is often used to ask permission from a user to execute something. Window confirm() takes a string as an argument. Clicking the OK yields true value, whereas clicking the Cancel button yields false value. const agree = confirm ( 'Are you sure you like to delete? ' ) console . log ( agree ) // result will be true or false based on what you click on the dialog box These are not all the window methods we will have a separate section to go deep into window methods. Date Object Time is an important thing. We like to know the time a certain activity or event. In JavaScript current time and date is created using JavaScript Date Object. The object we create using Date object provides many methods to work with date and time.The methods we use to get date and time information from a date object values are started with a word get because it provide the information. getFullYear(), getMonth(), getDate(), getDay(), getHours(), getMinutes, getSeconds(), getMilliseconds(), getTime(), getDay() Creating a time object Once we create time object. The time object will provide information about time. Let us create a time object const now = new Date () console . log ( now ) // Sat Jan 04 2020 00:56:41 GMT+0200 (Eastern European Standard Time) We have created a time object and we can access any date time information from the object using the get methods we have mentioned on the table. Getting full year Let's extract or get the full year from a time object. const now = new Date () console . log ( now . getFullYear ()) // 2020 Getting month Let's extract or get the month from a time object. const now = new Date () console . log ( now . getMonth ()) // 0, because the month is January, month(0-11) Getting date Let's extract or get the date of the month from a time object. const now = new Date () console . log ( now . getDate ()) // 4, because the day of the month is 4th, day(1-31) Getting day Let's extract or get the day of the week from a time object. const now = new Date () console . log ( now . getDay ()) // 6, because the day is Saturday which is the 7th day // Sunday is 0, Monday is 1 and Saturday is 6 // Getting the weekday as a number (0-6) Getting hours Let's extract or get the hours from a time object. const now = new Date () console . log ( now . getHours ()) // 0, because the time is 00:56:41 Getting minutes Let's extract or get the minutes from a time object. const now = new Date () console . log ( now . getMinutes ()) // 56, because the time is 00:56:41 Getting seconds Let's extract or get the seconds from a time object. const now = new Date () console . log ( now . getSeconds ()) // 41, because the time is 00:56:41 Getting time This method give time in milliseconds starting from January 1, 1970. It is also know as Unix time. We can get the unix time in two ways: Using getTime() const now = new Date () // console . log ( now . getTime ()) // 1578092201341, this is the number of seconds passed from January 1, 1970 to January 4, 2020 00:56:41 Using Date.now() const allSeconds = Date . now () // console . log ( allSeconds ) // 1578092201341, this is the number of seconds passed from January 1, 1970 to January 4, 2020 00:56:41 const timeInSeconds = new Date (). getTime () console . log ( allSeconds == timeInSeconds ) // true Let us format these values to a human readable time format. Example: const now = new Date () const year = now . getFullYear () // return year const month = now . getMonth () + 1 // return month(0 - 11) const date = now . getDate () // return date (1 - 31) const hours = now . getHours () // return number (0 - 23) const minutes = now . getMinutes () // return number (0 -59) console . log ( ` ${ date } / ${ month } / ${ year } ${ hours } : ${ minutes } ` ) // 4/1/2020 0:56 \ud83c\udf15 You have boundless energy.

By default , statements in JavaScript script executed sequentially from top to bottom. If the processing logic require so, the sequential flow of execution can be altered in two ways: Conditional execution: a block of one or more statements will be executed if a certain expression is true Repetitive execution: a block of one or more statements will be repetitively executed as long as a certain expression is true. In this section, we will cover if , else , else if statements. The comparison and logical operators we learned in the previous sections will be useful in here. Conditions can be implementing using the following ways: if if else if else if else switch ternary operator If In JavaScript and other programming languages the key word if is to used check if a condition is true and to execute the block code. To create an if condition, we need if keyword, condition inside a parenthesis and block of code inside a curly bracket({}). // syntax if ( condition ) { //this part of code runs for truthy condition } Example: let num = 3 if ( num > 0 ) { console . log ( ` ${ num } is a positive number` ) } // 3 is a positive number As you can see in the condition example above, 3 is greater than 0, so it is a positive number. The condition was true and the block of code was executed. However, if the condition is false, we won't see any results. let isRaining = true if ( isRaining ) { console . log ( 'Remember to take your rain coat.' ) } The same goes for the second condition, if isRaining is false the if block will not be executed and we do not see any output. In order to see the result of a falsy condition, we should have another block, which is going to be else . If Else If condition is true the first block will be executed, if not the else condition will be executed. // syntax if ( condition ) { // this part of code runs for truthy condition } else { // this part of code runs for false condition } let num = 3 if ( num > 0 ) { console . log ( ` ${ num } is a positive number` ) } else { console . log ( ` ${ num } is a negative number` ) } // 3 is a positive number num = - 3 if ( num > 0 ) { console . log ( ` ${ num } is a positive number` ) } else { console . log ( ` ${ num } is a negative number` ) } // -3 is a negative number let isRaining = true if ( isRaining ) { console . log ( 'You need a rain coat.' ) } else { console . log ( 'No need for a rain coat.' ) } // You need a rain coat. isRaining = false if ( isRaining ) { console . log ( 'You need a rain coat.' ) } else { console . log ( 'No need for a rain coat.' ) } // No need for a rain coat. The last condition is false, therefore the else block was executed. What if we have more than two conditions? In that case, we would use else if conditions. If Else if Else On our daily life, we make decisions on daily basis. We make decisions not by checking one or two conditions instead we make decisions based on multiple conditions. As similar to our daily life, programming is also full of conditions. We use else if when we have multiple conditions. // syntax if ( condition ) { // code } else if ( condition ) { // code } else { // code } Example: let a = 0 if ( a > 0 ) { console . log ( ` ${ a } is a positive number` ) } else if ( a < 0 ) { console . log ( ` ${ a } is a negative number` ) } else if ( a == 0 ) { console . log ( ` ${ a } is zero` ) } else { console . log ( ` ${ a } is not a number` ) } // if else if else let weather = 'sunny' if ( weather === 'rainy' ) { console . log ( 'You need a rain coat.' ) } else if ( weather === 'cloudy' ) { console . log ( 'It might be cold, you need a jacket.' ) } else if ( weather === 'sunny' ) { console . log ( 'Go out freely.' ) } else { console . log ( 'No need for rain coat.' ) } Switch Switch is an alternative for if else if else else . The switch statement starts with a switch keyword followed by a parenthesis and code block. Inside the code block we will have different cases. Case block runs if the value in the switch statement parenthesis matches with the case value. The break statement is to terminate execution so the code execution does not go down after the condition is satisfied. The default block runs if all the cases don't satisfy the condition. switch ( caseValue ){ case 1 : // code break case 2 : // code break case 3 : // code break default : // code } let weather = 'cloudy' switch ( weather ) { case 'rainy' : console . log ( 'You need a rain coat.' ) break case 'cloudy' : console . log ( 'It might be cold, you need a jacket.' ) break case 'sunny' : console . log ( 'Go out freely.' ) break default : console . log ( ' No need for rain coat.' ) } // Switch More Examples let dayUserInput = prompt ( 'What day is today ?' ) let day = dayUserInput . toLowerCase () switch ( day ) { case 'monday' : console . log ( 'Today is Monday' ) break case 'tuesday' : console . log ( 'Today is Tuesday' ) break case 'wednesday' : console . log ( 'Today is Wednesday' ) break case 'thursday' : console . log ( 'Today is Thursday' ) break case 'friday' : console . log ( 'Today is Friday' ) break case 'saturday' : console . log ( 'Today is Saturday' ) break case 'sunday' : console . log ( 'Today is Sunday' ) break default : console . log ( 'It is not a week day.' ) } // Examples to use conditions in the cases let num = prompt ( 'Enter number' ); switch ( true ) { case num > 0 : console . log ( 'Number is positive' ); break ; case num == 0 : console . log ( 'Numbers is zero' ); break ; case num < 0 : console . log ( 'Number is negative' ); break ; default : console . log ( 'Entered value was not a number' ); } Ternary Operators Another way to write conditionals is using ternary operators. We have covered this in other sections, but we should also mention it here. let isRaining = true isRaining ? console . log ( 'You need a rain coat.' ) : console . log ( 'No need for a rain coat.' ) \ud83c\udf15 You are extraordinary and you have a remarkable potential.

An array is a collection of different data types which are ordered and changeable(modifiable). An array allows storing duplicate elements and different data types. An array can be empty, or it may have different data type values. How to create an empty array In JavaScript, we can create an array in different ways. Let us see different ways to create an array. It is very common to use const instead of let to declare an array variable. If you ar using const it means you do not use that variable name again. Using Array constructor // syntax const arr = Array () // or // let arr = new Array() console . log ( arr ) // [] Using square brackets([]) // syntax // This the most recommended way to create an empty list const arr = [] console . log ( arr ) How to create an array with values Array with initial values. We use length property to find the length of an array. const numbers = [ 0 , 3.14 , 9.81 , 37 , 98.6 , 100 ] // array of numbers const fruits = [ 'banana' , 'orange' , 'mango' , 'lemon' ] // array of strings, fruits const vegetables = [ 'Tomato' , 'Potato' , 'Cabbage' , 'Onion' , 'Carrot' ] // array of strings, vegetables const animalProducts = [ 'milk' , 'meat' , 'butter' , 'yoghurt' ] // array of strings, products const webTechs = [ 'HTML' , 'CSS' , 'JS' , 'React' , 'Redux' , 'Node' , 'MongDB' ] // array of web technologies const countries = [ 'Finland' , 'Denmark' , 'Sweden' , 'Norway' , 'Iceland' ] // array of strings, countries // Print the array and its length console . log ( 'Numbers:' , numbers ) console . log ( 'Number of numbers:' , numbers . length ) console . log ( 'Fruits:' , fruits ) console . log ( 'Number of fruits:' , fruits . length ) console . log ( 'Vegetables:' , vegetables ) console . log ( 'Number of vegetables:' , vegetables . length ) console . log ( 'Animal products:' , animalProducts ) console . log ( 'Number of animal products:' , animalProducts . length ) console . log ( 'Web technologies:' , webTechs ) console . log ( 'Number of web technologies:' , webTechs . length ) console . log ( 'Countries:' , countries ) console . log ( 'Number of countries:' , countries . length ) Numbers: [ 0 , 3 .14, 9 .81, 37 , 98 .6, 100 ] Number of numbers: 6 Fruits: [ 'banana' , 'orange' , 'mango' , 'lemon' ] Number of fruits: 4 Vegetables: [ 'Tomato' , 'Potato' , 'Cabbage' , 'Onion' , 'Carrot' ] Number of vegetables: 5 Animal products: [ 'milk' , 'meat' , 'butter' , 'yoghurt' ] Number of animal products: 4 Web technologies: [ 'HTML' , 'CSS' , 'JS' , 'React' , 'Redux' , 'Node' , 'MongDB' ] Number of web technologies: 7 Countries: [ 'Finland' , 'Estonia' , 'Denmark' , 'Sweden' , 'Norway' ] Number of countries: 5 Array can have items of different data types const arr = [ 'Asabeneh' , 250 , true , { country : 'Finland' , city : 'Helsinki' }, { skills : [ 'HTML' , 'CSS' , 'JS' , 'React' , 'Python' ] } ] // arr containing different data types console . log ( arr ) Creating an array using split As we have seen in the earlier section, we can split a string at different positions, and we can change to an array. Let us see the examples below. let js = 'JavaScript' const charsInJavaScript = js . split ( '' ) console . log ( charsInJavaScript ) // [\"J\", \"a\", \"v\", \"a\", \"S\", \"c\", \"r\", \"i\", \"p\", \"t\"] let companiesString = 'Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Apple, IBM, Oracle, Amazon' const companies = companiesString . split ( ',' ) console . log ( companies ) // [\"Facebook\", \" Google\", \" Microsoft\", \" Apple\", \" IBM\", \" Oracle\", \" Amazon\"] let txt = 'I love teaching and empowering people. I teach HTML, CSS, JS, React, Python.' const words = txt . split ( ' ' ) console . log ( words ) // the text has special characters think how you can just get only the words // [\"I\", \"love\", \"teaching\", \"and\", \"empowering\", \"people.\", \"I\", \"teach\", \"HTML,\", \"CSS,\", \"JS,\", \"React,\", \"Python\"] Accessing array items using index We access each element in an array using their index. An array index starts from 0. The picture below clearly shows the index of each element in the array. const fruits = [ 'banana' , 'orange' , 'mango' , 'lemon' ] let firstFruit = fruits [ 0 ] // we are accessing the first item using its index console . log ( firstFruit ) // banana secondFruit = fruits [ 1 ] console . log ( secondFruit ) // orange let lastFruit = fruits [ 3 ] console . log ( lastFruit ) // lemon // Last index can be calculated as follows let lastIndex = fruits . length - 1 lastFruit = fruits [ lastIndex ] console . log ( lastFruit ) // lemon const numbers = [ 0 , 3.14 , 9.81 , 37 , 98.6 , 100 ] // set of numbers console . log ( numbers . length ) // => to know the size of the array, which is 6 console . log ( numbers ) // -> [0, 3.14, 9.81, 37, 98.6, 100] console . log ( numbers [ 0 ]) // -> 0 console . log ( numbers [ 5 ]) // -> 100 let lastIndex = numbers . length - 1 ; console . log ( numbers [ lastIndex ]) // -> 100 const webTechs = [ 'HTML' , 'CSS' , 'JavaScript' , 'React' , 'Redux' , 'Node' , 'MongoDB' ] // List of web technologies console . log ( webTechs ) // all the array items console . log ( webTechs . length ) // => to know the size of the array, which is 7 console . log ( webTechs [ 0 ]) // -> HTML console . log ( webTechs [ 6 ]) // -> MongoDB let lastIndex = webTechs . length - 1 console . log ( webTechs [ lastIndex ]) // -> MongoDB const countries = [ 'Albania' , 'Bolivia' , 'Canada' , 'Denmark' , 'Ethiopia' , 'Finland' , 'Germany' , 'Hungary' , 'Ireland' , 'Japan' , 'Kenya' ] // List of countries console . log ( countries ) // -> all countries in array console . log ( countries [ 0 ]) // -> Albania console . log ( countries [ 10 ]) // -> Kenya let lastIndex = countries . length - 1 ; console . log ( countries [ lastIndex ]) // -> Kenya const shoppingCart = [ 'Milk' , 'Mango' , 'Tomato' , 'Potato' , 'Avocado' , 'Meat' , 'Eggs' , 'Sugar' ] // List of food products console . log ( shoppingCart ) // -> all shoppingCart in array console . log ( shoppingCart [ 0 ]) // -> Milk console . log ( shoppingCart [ 7 ]) // -> Sugar let lastIndex = shoppingCart . length - 1 ; console . log ( shoppingCart [ lastIndex ]) // -> Sugar Modifying array element An array is mutable(modifiable). Once an array is created, we can modify the contents of the array elements. const numbers = [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ] numbers [ 0 ] = 10 // changing 1 at index 0 to 10 numbers [ 1 ] = 20 // changing 2 at index 1 to 20 console . log ( numbers ) // [10, 20, 3, 4, 5] const countries = [ 'Albania' , 'Bolivia' , 'Canada' , 'Denmark' , 'Ethiopia' , 'Finland' , 'Germany' , 'Hungary' , 'Ireland' , 'Japan' , 'Kenya' ] countries [ 0 ] = 'Afghanistan' // Replacing Albania by Afghanistan let lastIndex = countries . length - 1 countries [ lastIndex ] = 'Korea' // Replacing Kenya by Korea console . log ( countries ) [ \"Afghanistan\" , \"Bolivia\" , \"Canada\" , \"Denmark\" , \"Ethiopia\" , \"Finland\" , \"Germany\" , \"Hungary\" , \"Ireland\" , \"Japan\" , \"Korea\" ] Methods to manipulate array There are different methods to manipulate an array. These are some of the available methods to deal with arrays: Array, length, concat, indexOf, slice, splice, join, toString, includes, lastIndexOf, isArray, fill, push, pop, shift, unshift Array Constructor Array:To create an array. const arr = Array () // creates an an empty array console . log ( arr ) const eightEmptyValues = Array ( 8 ) // it creates eight empty values console . log ( eightEmptyValues ) // [empty x 8] Creating static values with fill fill: Fill all the array elements with a static value const arr = Array () // creates an an empty array console . log ( arr ) const eightXvalues = Array ( 8 ). fill ( 'X' ) // it creates eight element values filled with 'X' console . log ( eightXvalues ) // ['X', 'X','X','X','X','X','X','X'] const eight0values = Array ( 8 ). fill ( 0 ) // it creates eight element values filled with '0' console . log ( eight0values ) // [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] const four4values = Array ( 4 ). fill ( 4 ) // it creates 4 element values filled with '4' console . log ( four4values ) // [4, 4, 4, 4] Concatenating array using concat concat:To concatenate two arrays. const firstList = [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] const secondList = [ 4 , 5 , 6 ] const thirdList = firstList . concat ( secondList ) console . log ( thirdList ) // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] const fruits = [ 'banana' , 'orange' , 'mango' , 'lemon' ] // array of fruits const vegetables = [ 'Tomato' , 'Potato' , 'Cabbage' , 'Onion' , 'Carrot' ] // array of vegetables const fruitsAndVegetables = fruits . concat ( vegetables ) // concatenate the two arrays console . log ( fruitsAndVegetables ) [ \"banana\" , \"orange\" , \"mango\" , \"lemon\" , \"Tomato\" , \"Potato\" , \"Cabbage\" , \"Onion\" , \"Carrot\" ] Getting array length Length:To know the size of the array const numbers = [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ] console . log ( numbers . length ) // -> 5 is the size of the array Getting index an element in arr array indexOf:To check if an item exist in an array. If it exists it returns the index else it returns -1. const numbers = [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ] console . log ( numbers . indexOf ( 5 )) // -> 4 console . log ( numbers . indexOf ( 0 )) // -> -1 console . log ( numbers . indexOf ( 1 )) // -> 0 console . log ( numbers . indexOf ( 6 )) // -> -1 Check an element if it exist in an array. Check items in a list // let us check if a banana exist in the array const fruits = [ 'banana' , 'orange' , 'mango' , 'lemon' ] let index = fruits . indexOf ( 'banana' ) // 0 if ( index === - 1 ){ console . log ( 'This fruit does not exist in the array' ) } else { console . log ( 'This fruit does exist in the array' ) } // This fruit does exist in the array // we can use also ternary here index === - 1 ? console . log ( 'This fruit does not exist in the array' ) : console . log ( 'This fruit does exist in the array' ) // let us check if an avocado exist in the array let indexOfAvocado = fruits . indexOf ( 'avocado' ) // -1, if the element not found index is -1 if ( indexOfAvocado === - 1 ){ console . log ( 'This fruit does not exist in the array' ) } else { console . log ( 'This fruit does exist in the array' ) } // This fruit does not exist in the array Getting last index of an element in array lastIndexOf: It gives the position of the last item in the array. If it exist, it returns the index else it returns -1. const numbers = [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 3 , 1 , 2 ] console . log ( numbers . lastIndexOf ( 2 )) // 7 console . log ( numbers . lastIndexOf ( 0 )) // -1 console . log ( numbers . lastIndexOf ( 1 )) // 6 console . log ( numbers . lastIndexOf ( 4 )) // 3 console . log ( numbers . lastIndexOf ( 6 )) // -1 includes:To check if an item exist in an array. If it exist it returns the true else it returns false. const numbers = [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ] console . log ( numbers . includes ( 5 )) // true console . log ( numbers . includes ( 0 )) // false console . log ( numbers . includes ( 1 )) // true console . log ( numbers . includes ( 6 )) // false const webTechs = [ 'HTML' , 'CSS' , 'JavaScript' , 'React' , 'Redux' , 'Node' , 'MongoDB' ] // List of web technologies console . log ( webTechs . includes ( 'Node' )) // true console . log ( webTechs . includes ( 'C' )) // false Checking array Array.isArray:To check if the data type is an array const numbers = [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ] console . log ( Array . isArray ( numbers )) // true const number = 100 console . log ( Array . isArray ( number )) // false Converting array to string toString:Converts array to string const numbers = [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ] console . log ( numbers . toString ()) // 1,2,3,4,5 const names = [ 'Asabeneh' , 'Mathias' , 'Elias' , 'Brook' ] console . log ( names . toString ()) // Asabeneh,Mathias,Elias,Brook Joining array elements join: It is used to join the elements of the array, the argument we passed in the join method will be joined in the array and return as a string. By default, it joins with a comma, but we can pass different string parameter which can be joined between the items. const numbers = [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ] console . log ( numbers . join ()) // 1,2,3,4,5 const names = [ 'Asabeneh' , 'Mathias' , 'Elias' , 'Brook' ] console . log ( names . join ()) // Asabeneh,Mathias,Elias,Brook console . log ( names . join ( '' )) //AsabenehMathiasEliasBrook console . log ( names . join ( ' ' )) //Asabeneh Mathias Elias Brook console . log ( names . join ( ', ' )) //Asabeneh, Mathias, Elias, Brook console . log ( names . join ( ' # ' )) //Asabeneh # Mathias # Elias # Brook const webTechs = [ 'HTML' , 'CSS' , 'JavaScript' , 'React' , 'Redux' , 'Node' , 'MongoDB' ] // List of web technologies console . log ( webTechs . join ()) // \"HTML,CSS,JavaScript,React,Redux,Node,MongoDB\" console . log ( webTechs . join ( ' # ' )) // \"HTML # CSS # JavaScript # React # Redux # Node # MongoDB\" Slice array elements Slice: To cut out a multiple items in range. It takes two parameters:starting and ending position. It doesn't include the ending position. const numbers = [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ] console . log ( numbers . slice ()) // -> it copies all item console . log ( numbers . slice ( 0 )) // -> it copies all item console . log ( numbers . slice ( 0 , numbers . length )) // it copies all item console . log ( numbers . slice ( 1 , 4 )) // -> [2,3,4] // it doesn't include the ending position Splice method in array Splice: It takes three parameters:Starting position, number of times to be removed and number of items to be added. const numbers = [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ] numbers . splice () console . log ( numbers ) // -> remove all items const numbers = [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ] numbers . splice ( 0 , 1 ) console . log ( numbers ) // remove the first item const numbers = [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 ] numbers . splice ( 3 , 3 , 7 , 8 , 9 ) console . log ( numbers . splice ( 3 , 3 , 7 , 8 , 9 )) // -> [1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9] //it removes three item and replace three items Adding item to an array using push Push: adding item in the end. To add item to the end of an existing array we use the push method. // syntax const arr = [ 'item1' , 'item2' , 'item3' ] arr . push ( 'new item' ) console . log ( arr ) // ['item1', 'item2','item3','new item'] const numbers = [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ] numbers . push ( 6 ) console . log ( numbers ) // -> [1,2,3,4,5,6] numbers . pop () // -> remove one item from the end console . log ( numbers ) // -> [1,2,3,4,5] let fruits = [ 'banana' , 'orange' , 'mango' , 'lemon' ] fruits . push ( 'apple' ) console . log ( fruits ) // ['banana', 'orange', 'mango', 'lemon', 'apple'] fruits . push ( 'lime' ) console . log ( fruits ) // ['banana', 'orange', 'mango', 'lemon', 'apple', 'lime'] Removing the end element using pop pop: Removing item in the end. const numbers = [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ] numbers . pop () // -> remove one item from the end console . log ( numbers ) // -> [1,2,3,4] Removing an element from the beginning shift: Removing one array element in the beginning of the array. const numbers = [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ] numbers . shift () // -> remove one item from the beginning console . log ( numbers ) // -> [2,3,4,5] Add an element from the beginning unshift: Adding array element in the beginning of the array. const numbers = [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ] numbers . unshift ( 0 ) // -> add one item from the beginning console . log ( numbers ) // -> [0,1,2,3,4,5] Reversing array order reverse: reverse the order of an array. const numbers = [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ] numbers . reverse () // -> reverse array order console . log ( numbers ) // [5, 4, 3, 2, 1] numbers . reverse () console . log ( numbers ) // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] Sorting elements in array sort: arrange array elements in ascending order. Sort takes a call back function, we will see how we use sort with a call back function in the coming sections. const webTechs = [ 'HTML' , 'CSS' , 'JavaScript' , 'React' , 'Redux' , 'Node' , 'MongoDB' ] webTechs . sort () console . log ( webTechs ) // [\"CSS\", \"HTML\", \"JavaScript\", \"MongoDB\", \"Node\", \"React\", \"Redux\"] webTechs . reverse () // after sorting we can reverse it console . log ( webTechs ) // [\"Redux\", \"React\", \"Node\", \"MongoDB\", \"JavaScript\", \"HTML\", \"CSS\"] Array of arrays Array can store different data types including an array itself. Let us create an array of arrays const firstNums = [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] const secondNums = [ 1 , 4 , 9 ] const arrayOfArray = [[ 1 , 2 , 3 ], [ 1 , 2 , 3 ]] console . log ( arrayOfArray [ 0 ]) // [1, 2, 3] const frontEnd = [ 'HTML' , 'CSS' , 'JS' , 'React' , 'Redux' ] const backEnd = [ 'Node' , 'Express' , 'MongoDB' ] const fullStack = [ frontEnd , backEnd ] console . log ( fullStack ) // [[\"HTML\", \"CSS\", \"JS\", \"React\", \"Redux\"], [\"Node\", \"Express\", \"MongoDB\"]] console . log ( fullStack . length ) // 2 console . log ( fullStack [ 0 ]) // [\"HTML\", \"CSS\", \"JS\", \"React\", \"Redux\"] console . log ( fullStack [ 1 ]) // [\"Node\", \"Express\", \"MongoDB\"] \ud83c\udf15 You are diligent and you have already achieved quite a lot.

In this section, we will focus on custom functions. What is a function? Before we start making functions, lets understand what function is and why we need function? A function is a reusable block of code or programming statements designed to perform a certain task. A function is declared by a function key word followed by a name, followed by parentheses (). A parentheses can take a parameter. If a function take a parameter it will be called with argument. A function can also take a default parameter. To store a data to a function, a function has to return certain data types. To get the value we call or invoke a function. Function makes code: clean and easy to read reusable easy to test A function can be declared or created in couple of ways: Declaration function Expression function Anonymous function Arrow function Function Declaration Let us see how to declare a function and how to call a function. //declaring a function without a parameter function functionName () { // code goes here } functionName () // calling function by its name and with parentheses Function without a parameter and return Function can be declared without a parameter. Example: // function without parameter, a function which make a number square function square () { let num = 2 let sq = num * num console . log ( sq ) } square () // 4 // function without parameter function addTwoNumbers () { let numOne = 10 let numTwo = 20 let sum = numOne + numTwo console . log ( sum ) } addTwoNumbers () // a function has to be called by its name to be executed function printFullName (){ let firstName = 'Asabeneh' let lastName = 'Yetayeh' let space = ' ' let fullName = firstName + space + lastName console . log ( fullName ) } printFullName () // calling a function Function returning value Function can also return values, if a function does not return values the value of the function is undefined. Let us write the above functions with return. From now on, we return value to a function instead of printing it. function printFullName (){ let firstName = 'Asabeneh' let lastName = 'Yetayeh' let space = ' ' let fullName = firstName + space + lastName return fullName } console . log ( printFullName ()) function addTwoNumbers () { let numOne = 2 let numTwo = 3 let total = numOne + numTwo return total } console . log ( addTwoNumbers ()) Function with a parameter In a function we can pass different data types(number, string, boolean, object, function) as a parameter. // function with one parameter function functionName ( parm1 ) { //code goes her } functionName ( parm1 ) // during calling or invoking one argument needed function areaOfCircle ( r ) { let area = Math . PI * r * r return area } console . log ( areaOfCircle ( 10 )) // should be called with one argument function square ( number ) { return number * number } console . log ( square ( 10 )) Function with two parameters // function with two parameters function functionName ( parm1 , parm2 ) { //code goes her } functionName ( parm1 , parm2 ) // during calling or invoking two arguments needed // Function without parameter doesn't take input, so lets make a function with parameters function sumTwoNumbers ( numOne , numTwo ) { let sum = numOne + numTwo console . log ( sum ) } sumTwoNumbers ( 10 , 20 ) // calling functions // If a function doesn't return it doesn't store data, so it should return function sumTwoNumbers ( numOne , numTwo ) { let sum = numOne + numTwo return sum } console . log ( sumTwoNumbers ( 10 , 20 )) function printFullName ( firstName , lastName ) { return ` ${ firstName } ${ lastName } ` } console . log ( printFullName ( 'Asabeneh' , 'Yetayeh' )) Function with many parameters // function with multiple parameters function functionName ( parm1 , parm2 , parm3 ,...){ //code goes here } functionName ( parm1 , parm2 , parm3 ,...) // during calling or invoking three arguments needed // this function takes array as a parameter and sum up the numbers in the array function sumArrayValues ( arr ) { let sum = 0 ; for ( let i = 0 ; i < arr . length ; i ++ ) { sum = sum + arr [ i ]; } return sum ; } const numbers = [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ]; //calling a function console . log ( sumArrayValues ( numbers )); const areaOfCircle = ( radius ) => { let area = Math . PI * radius * radius ; return area ; } console . log ( areaOfCircle ( 10 )) Function with unlimited number of parameters Sometimes we do not know how many arguments the user going to pass. Therefore, we should know how to write a function which can take unlimited number of arguments. The way we do it has a significant difference between a function declaration(regular function) and arrow function. Let us see examples both in function declaration and arrow function. Unlimited number of parameters in regular function A function declaration provides a function scoped arguments array like object. Any thing we passed as argument in the function can be accessed from arguments object inside the functions. Let us see an example // Let us access the arguments object \u200b function sumAllNums () { console . log ( arguments ) } sumAllNums ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ) // Arguments(4) [1, 2, 3, 4, callee: \u0192, Symbol(Symbol.iterator): \u0192] // function declaration \u200b function sumAllNums () { let sum = 0 for ( let i = 0 ; i < arguments . length ; i ++ ) { sum += arguments [ i ] } return sum } console . log ( sumAllNums ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 )) // 10 console . log ( sumAllNums ( 10 , 20 , 13 , 40 , 10 )) // 93 console . log ( sumAllNums ( 15 , 20 , 30 , 25 , 10 , 33 , 40 )) // 173 Unlimited number of parameters in arrow function Arrow function does not have the function scoped arguments object. To implement a function which takes unlimited number of arguments in an arrow function we use spread operator followed by any parameter name. Any thing we passed as argument in the function can be accessed as array in the arrow function. Let us see an example // Let us access the arguments object \u200b const sumAllNums = (... args ) => { // console.log(arguments), arguments object not found in arrow function // instead we use a parameter followed by spread operator (...) console . log ( args ) } sumAllNums ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ) // [1, 2, 3, 4] // function declaration \u200b const sumAllNums = (... args ) => { let sum = 0 for ( const element of args ) { sum += element } return sum } console . log ( sumAllNums ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 )) // 10 console . log ( sumAllNums ( 10 , 20 , 13 , 40 , 10 )) // 93 console . log ( sumAllNums ( 15 , 20 , 30 , 25 , 10 , 33 , 40 )) // 173 Anonymous Function Anonymous function or without name const anonymousFun = function () { console . log ( 'I am an anonymous function and my value is stored in anonymousFun' ) } Expression Function Expression functions are anonymous functions. After we create a function without a name and we assign it to a variable. To return a value from the function we should call the variable. Look at the example below. // Function expression const square = function ( n ) { return n * n } console . log ( square ( 2 )) // -> 4 Self Invoking Functions Self invoking functions are anonymous functions which do not need to be called to return a value. ( function ( n ) { console . log ( n * n ) })( 2 ) // 4, but instead of just printing if we want to return and store the data, we do as shown below let squaredNum = ( function ( n ) { return n * n })( 10 ) console . log ( squaredNum ) Arrow Function Arrow function is an alternative to write a function, however function declaration and arrow function have some minor differences. Arrow function uses arrow instead of the keyword function to declare a function. Let us see both function declaration and arrow function. // This is how we write normal or declaration function // Let us change this declaration function to an arrow function function square ( n ) { return n * n } console . log ( square ( 2 )) // 4 const square = n => { return n * n } console . log ( square ( 2 )) // -> 4 // if we have only one line in the code block, it can be written as follows, explicit return const square = n => n * n // -> 4 const changeToUpperCase = arr => { const newArr = [] for ( const element of arr ) { newArr . push ( element . toUpperCase ()) } return newArr } const countries = [ 'Finland' , 'Sweden' , 'Norway' , 'Denmark' , 'Iceland' ] console . log ( changeToUpperCase ( countries )) // [\"FINLAND\", \"SWEDEN\", \"NORWAY\", \"DENMARK\", \"ICELAND\"] const printFullName = ( firstName , lastName ) => { return ` ${ firstName } ${ lastName } ` } console . log ( printFullName ( 'Asabeneh' , 'Yetayeh' )) The above function has only the return statement, therefore, we can explicitly return it as follows. const printFullName = ( firstName , lastName ) => ` ${ firstName } ${ lastName } ` console . log ( printFullName ( 'Asabeneh' , 'Yetayeh' )) Function with default parameters Sometimes we pass default values to parameters, when we invoke the function if we do not pass an argument the default value will be used. Both function declaration and arrow function can have a default value or values. // syntax // Declaring a function function functionName ( param = value ) { //codes } // Calling function functionName () functionName ( arg ) Example: function greetings ( name = 'Peter' ) { let message = ` ${ name } , welcome to 30 Days Of JavaScript!` return message } console . log ( greetings ()) console . log ( greetings ( 'Asabeneh' )) function generateFullName ( firstName = 'Asabeneh' , lastName = 'Yetayeh' ) { let space = ' ' let fullName = firstName + space + lastName return fullName } console . log ( generateFullName ()) console . log ( generateFullName ( 'David' , 'Smith' )) function calculateAge ( birthYear , currentYear = 2019 ) { let age = currentYear - birthYear return age } console . log ( 'Age: ' , calculateAge ( 1819 )) function weightOfObject ( mass , gravity = 9.81 ) { let weight = mass * gravity + ' N' // the value has to be changed to string first return weight } console . log ( 'Weight of an object in Newton: ' , weightOfObject ( 100 )) // 9.81 gravity at the surface of Earth console . log ( 'Weight of an object in Newton: ' , weightOfObject ( 100 , 1.62 )) // gravity at surface of Moon Let us see how we write the above functions with arrow functions // syntax // Declaring a function const functionName = ( param = value ) => { //codes } // Calling function functionName () functionName ( arg ) Example: const greetings = ( name = 'Peter' ) => { let message = name + ', welcome to 30 Days Of JavaScript!' return message } console . log ( greetings ()) console . log ( greetings ( 'Asabeneh' )) const generateFullName = ( firstName = 'Asabeneh' , lastName = 'Yetayeh' ) => { let space = ' ' let fullName = firstName + space + lastName return fullName } console . log ( generateFullName ()) console . log ( generateFullName ( 'David' , 'Smith' )) const calculateAge = ( birthYear , currentYear = 2019 ) => currentYear - birthYear console . log ( 'Age: ' , calculateAge ( 1819 )) const weightOfObject = ( mass , gravity = 9.81 ) => mass * gravity + ' N' console . log ( 'Weight of an object in Newton: ' , weightOfObject ( 100 )) // 9.81 gravity at the surface of Earth console . log ( 'Weight of an object in Newton: ' , weightOfObject ( 100 , 1.62 )) // gravity at surface of Moon Function declaration versus Arrow function It Will be covered in other section. \ud83c\udf15 You are a rising star, now you knew function .

A function is a reusable block of code or programming statements designed to perform a certain task. A function is declared by a function key word followed by a name, followed by parentheses (). A parentheses can take a parameter. If a function take a parameter it will be called with argument. A function can also take a default parameter. To store a data to a function, a function has to return certain data types. To get the value we call or invoke a function.

We declare variable to store different data types. To declare a variable we use the key word var , let and const . A variable can be declared at different scope. In this section, we will see the scope variables, scope of variables when we use var or let. Variables scopes can be: Global Local Variable can be declared globally or locally scope. We will see both global and local scope. Anything declared without let, var or const is scoped at global level. Let us imagine that we have a scope.js file. Window Global Object Without using console.log() open your browser and check, you will see the value of a and b if you write a or b on the browser. That means a and b are already available in the window. //scope.js a = 'JavaScript' // declaring a variable without let or const make it available in window object and this found anywhere b = 10 // this is a global scope variable and found in the window object function letsLearnScope () { console . log ( a , b ) if ( true ) { console . log ( a , b ) } } console . log ( a , b ) // accessible Global scope A globally declared variable can be accessed every where in the same file. But the term global is relative. It can be global to the file or it can be global relative to some block of codes. //scope.js let a = 'JavaScript' // is a global scope it will be found anywhere in this file let b = 10 // is a global scope it will be found anywhere in this file function letsLearnScope () { console . log ( a , b ) // JavaScript 10, accessible if ( true ) { let a = 'Python' let b = 100 console . log ( a , b ) // Python 100 } console . log ( a , b ) } letsLearnScope () console . log ( a , b ) // JavaScript 10, accessible Local scope A variable declared as local can be accessed only in certain block code. Block Scope Function Scope //scope.js let a = 'JavaScript' // is a global scope it will be found anywhere in this file let b = 10 // is a global scope it will be found anywhere in this file // Function scope function letsLearnScope () { console . log ( a , b ) // JavaScript 10, accessible let value = false // block scope if ( true ) { // we can access from the function and outside the function but // variables declared inside the if will not be accessed outside the if block let a = 'Python' let b = 20 let c = 30 let d = 40 value = ! value console . log ( a , b , c , value ) // Python 20 30 true } // we can not access c because c's scope is only the if block console . log ( a , b , value ) // JavaScript 10 true } letsLearnScope () console . log ( a , b ) // JavaScript 10, accessible Now, you have an understanding of scope. A variable declared with var only scoped to function but variable declared with let or const is block scope(function block, if block, loop block, etc). Block in JavaScript is a code in between two curly brackets ({}). //scope.js function letsLearnScope () { var gravity = 9.81 console . log ( gravity ) } // console.log(gravity), Uncaught ReferenceError: gravity is not defined if ( true ){ var gravity = 9.81 console . log ( gravity ) // 9.81 } console . log ( gravity ) // 9.81 for ( var i = 0 ; i < 3 ; i ++ ){ console . log ( i ) // 0, 1, 2 } console . log ( i ) // 3 In ES6 and above there is let and const , so you will not suffer from the sneakiness of var . When we use let our variable is block scoped and it will not infect other parts of our code. //scope.js function letsLearnScope () { // you can use let or const, but gravity is constant I prefer to use const const gravity = 9.81 console . log ( gravity ) } // console.log(gravity), Uncaught ReferenceError: gravity is not defined if ( true ){ const gravity = 9.81 console . log ( gravity ) // 9.81 } // console.log(gravity), Uncaught ReferenceError: gravity is not defined for ( let i = 0 ; i < 3 ; i ++ ){ console . log ( i ) // 0, 1, 2 } // console.log(i), Uncaught ReferenceError: i is not defined The scope let and const are the same. The difference is only reassigning. We can not change or reassign the value of the const variable. I would strongly suggest you to use let and const , by using let and const you will write clean code and avoid hard to debug mistakes. As a rule of thumb, you can use let for any value which change, const for any constant value, and for an array, object, arrow function and function expression. \ud83d\udcd4 Object Everything can be an object and objects do have properties and properties have values, so an object is a key value pair. The order of the key is not reserved, or there is no order. To create an object literal, we use two curly brackets. Creating an empty object An empty object const person = {} Creating an objecting with values Now, the person object has firstName, lastName, age, location, skills and isMarried properties. The value of properties or keys could be a string, number, boolean, an object, null, undefined or a function. Let us see some examples of object. Each key has a value in the object. const rectangle = { length : 20 , width : 20 } console . log ( rectangle ) // {length: 20, width: 20} const person = { firstName : 'Asabeneh' , lastName : 'Yetayeh' , age : 250 , country : 'Finland' , city : 'Helsinki' , skills : [ 'HTML' , 'CSS' , 'JavaScript' , 'React' , 'Node' , 'MongoDB' , 'Python' , 'D3.js' ], isMarried : true } console . log ( person ) Getting values from an object We can access values of object using two methods: using . followed by key name if the key-name is a one word using square bracket and a quote const person = { firstName : 'Asabeneh' , lastName : 'Yetayeh' , age : 250 , country : 'Finland' , city : 'Helsinki' , skills : [ 'HTML' , 'CSS' , 'JavaScript' , 'React' , 'Node' , 'MongoDB' , 'Python' , 'D3.js' ], getFullName : function () { return ` ${ this . firstName }${ this . lastName } ` }, 'phone number' : '+3584545454545' } // accessing values using . console . log ( person . firstName ) console . log ( person . lastName ) console . log ( person . age ) console . log ( person . location ) // undefined // value can be accessed using square bracket and key name console . log ( person [ 'firstName' ]) console . log ( person [ 'lastName' ]) console . log ( person [ 'age' ]) console . log ( person [ 'age' ]) console . log ( person [ 'location' ]) // undefined // for instance to access the phone number we only use the square bracket method console . log ( person [ 'phone number' ]) Creating object methods Now, the person object has getFullName properties. The getFullName is function inside the person object and we call it an object method. The this key word refers to the object itself. We can use the word this to access the values of different properties of the object. We can not use an arrow function as object method because the word this refers to the window inside an arrow function instead of the object itself. Example of object: const person = { firstName : 'Asabeneh' , lastName : 'Yetayeh' , age : 250 , country : 'Finland' , city : 'Helsinki' , skills : [ 'HTML' , 'CSS' , 'JavaScript' , 'React' , 'Node' , 'MongoDB' , 'Python' , 'D3.js' ], getFullName : function () { return ` ${ this . firstName } ${ this . lastName } ` } } console . log ( person . getFullName ()) // Asabeneh Yetayeh Setting new key for an object An object is a mutable data structure and we can modify the content of an object after it gets created. Setting a new keys in an object const person = { firstName : 'Asabeneh' , lastName : 'Yetayeh' , age : 250 , country : 'Finland' , city : 'Helsinki' , skills : [ 'HTML' , 'CSS' , 'JavaScript' , 'React' , 'Node' , 'MongoDB' , 'Python' , 'D3.js' ], getFullName : function () { return ` ${ this . firstName } ${ this . lastName } ` } } person . nationality = 'Ethiopian' person . country = 'Finland' person . title = 'teacher' person . skills . push ( 'Meteor' ) person . skills . push ( 'SasS' ) person . isMarried = true person . getPersonInfo = function () { let skillsWithoutLastSkill = this . skills . splice ( 0 , this . skills . length - 1 ) . join ( ', ' ) let lastSkill = this . skills . splice ( this . skills . length - 1 )[ 0 ] let skills = ` ${ skillsWithoutLastSkill } , and ${ lastSkill } ` let fullName = this . getFullName () let statement = ` ${ fullName } is a ${ this . title } .\\nHe lives in ${ this . country } .\\nHe teaches ${ skills } .` return statement } console . log ( person ) console . log ( person . getPersonInfo ()) Asabeneh Yetayeh is a teacher. He lives in Finland. He teaches HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node, MongoDB, Python, D3.js, Meteor, and SasS. Object Methods There are different methods to manipulate an object. Let us see some of the available methods. Object.assign : To copy an object without modifying the original object const person = { firstName : 'Asabeneh' , age : 250 , country : 'Finland' , city : 'Helsinki' , skills : [ 'HTML' , 'CSS' , 'JS' ], title : 'teacher' , address : { street : 'Heitamienkatu 16' , pobox : 2002 , city : 'Helsinki' }, getPersonInfo : function () { return `I am ${ this . firstName } and I live in ${ this . city } , ${ this . country } . I am ${ this . age } .` } } //Object methods: Object.assign, Object.keys, Object.values, Object.entries //hasOwnProperty const copyPerson = Object . assign ({}, person ) console . log ( copyPerson ) Getting object keys using Object.keys() Object.keys : To get the keys or properties of an object as an array const keys = Object . keys ( copyPerson ) console . log ( keys ) //['firstName', 'age', 'country','city', 'skills','title', 'address', 'getPersonInfo'] const address = Object . keys ( copyPerson . address ) console . log ( address ) //['street', 'pobox', 'city'] Getting object values using Object.values() Object.values :To get values of an object as an array const values = Object . values ( copyPerson ) console . log ( values ) Getting object keys and values using Object.entries() Object.entries :To get the keys and values in an array const entries = Object . entries ( copyPerson ) console . log ( entries ) Checking properties using hasOwnProperty() hasOwnProperty : To check if a specific key or property exist in an object console . log ( copyPerson . hasOwnProperty ( 'name' )) console . log ( copyPerson . hasOwnProperty ( 'score' )) \ud83c\udf15 You are astonishing.

The difference is only reassigning. We can not change or reassign the value of the const variable. I would strongly suggest you to use let and const , by using let and const you will write clean code and avoid hard to debug mistakes.

The function passed as a parameter is called callback. Callback A callback is a function which can be passed as parameter to other function. See the example below. // a callback function, the name of the function could be any name const callback = ( n ) => { return n ** 2 } \u200b // function that takes other function as a callback function cube ( callback , n ) { return callback ( n ) * n } \u200b console . log ( cube ( callback , 3 )) Returning function Higher order functions return function as a value \u200b // Higher order function returning an other function const higherOrder = n => { const doSomething = m => { const doWhatEver = t => { return 2 * n + 3 * m + t } return doWhatEver } return doSomething } console . log ( higherOrder ( 2 )( 3 )( 10 )) Let us see were we use call back functions. For instance the forEach method uses call back. const numbers = [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ] const sumArray = arr => { let sum = 0 const callback = function ( element ) { sum += element } arr . forEach ( callback ) return sum } console . log ( sumArray ( numbers )) 15 The above example can be simplified as follows: const numbers = [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ] \u200b const sumArray = arr => { let sum = 0 arr . forEach ( function ( element ) { sum += element }) return sum } console . log ( sumArray ( numbers )) 15 Setting time In JavaScript we can execute some activities in a certain interval of time or we can schedule(wait) for some time to execute some activities. setInterval setTimeout Setting Interval using a setInterval function In JavaScript, we use setInterval higher order function to do some activity continuously with in some interval of time. The setInterval global method take a callback function and a duration as a parameter. The duration is in milliseconds and the callback will be always called in that interval of time. // syntax function callback () { // code goes here } setInterval ( callback , duration ) function sayHello () { console . log ( 'Hello' ) } setInterval ( sayHello , 1000 ) // it prints hello in every second, 1000ms is 1s Setting a time using a setTimeout In JavaScript, we use setTimeout higher order function to execute some action at some time in the future. The setTimeout global method take a callback function and a duration as a parameter. The duration is in milliseconds and the callback wait for that amount of time. // syntax function callback () { // code goes here } setTimeout ( callback , duration ) // duration in milliseconds function sayHello () { console . log ( 'Hello' ) } setTimeout ( sayHello , 2000 ) // it prints hello after it waits for 2 seconds. Functional Programming Instead of writing regular loop, latest version of JavaScript introduced lots of built in methods which can help us to solve complicated problems. All builtin methods take callback function. In this section, we will see forEach , map , filter , reduce , find , every , some , and sort . forEach forEach : Iterate an array elements. We use forEach only with arrays. It takes a callback function with elements, index parameter and array itself. The index and the array optional. arr . forEach ( function ( element , index , arr ) { console . log ( index , element , arr ) }) // The above code can be written using arrow function arr . forEach (( element , index , arr ) => { console . log ( index , element , arr ) }) // The above code can be written using arrow function and explicit return arr . forEach (( element , index , arr ) => console . log ( index , element , arr )) let sum = 0 ; const numbers = [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ]; numbers . forEach ( num => console . log ( num )) console . log ( sum ) 1 2 3 4 5 let sum = 0 ; const numbers = [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ]; numbers . forEach ( num => sum += num ) console . log ( sum ) 15 const countries = [ 'Finland' , 'Denmark' , 'Sweden' , 'Norway' , 'Iceland' ] countries . forEach (( element ) => console . log ( element . toUpperCase ())) FINLAND DENMARK SWEDEN NORWAY ICELAND map map : Iterate an array elements and modify the array elements.

The call back function takes accumulator, current, and optional initial value as a parameter and returns a single value. It is a good practice to define an initial value for the accumulator value. If we do not specify this parameter, by default accumulator will get array first value . If our array is an empty array , then Javascript will throw an error. arr . reduce (( acc , cur ) => { // some operations goes here before returning a value return }, initialValue ) const numbers = [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ] const sum = numbers . reduce (( acc , cur ) => acc + cur , 0 ) console . log ( sum ) 15 every every : Check if all the elements are similar in one aspect.

By default, the sort() method sorts values as strings.This works well for string array items but not for numbers. If number values are sorted as strings and it give us wrong result. Sort method modify the original array. It is recommended to copy the original data before you start using sort method. Sorting string values const products = [ 'Milk' , 'Coffee' , 'Sugar' , 'Honey' , 'Apple' , 'Carrot' ] console . log ( products . sort ()) // ['Apple', 'Carrot', 'Coffee', 'Honey', 'Milk', 'Sugar'] //Now the original products array is also sorted Sorting Numeric values As you can see in the example below, 100 came first after sorted in ascending order. Sort converts items to string , since '100' and other numbers compared, 1 which the beginning of the string '100' became the smallest. To avoid this, we use a compare call back function inside the sort method, which return a negative, zero or positive. const numbers = [ 9.81 , 3.14 , 100 , 37 ] // Using sort method to sort number items provide a wrong result. see below console . log ( numbers . sort ()) //[100, 3.14, 37, 9.81] numbers . sort ( function ( a , b ) { return a - b }) console . log ( numbers ) // [3.14, 9.81, 37, 100] numbers . sort ( function ( a , b ) { return b - a }) console . log ( numbers ) //[100, 37, 9.81, 3.14] Sorting Object Arrays Whenever we sort objects in an array, we use the object key to compare. Let us see the example below. objArr . sort ( function ( a , b ) { if ( a . key < b . key ) return - 1 if ( a . key > b . key ) return 1 return 0 }) // or objArr . sort ( function ( a , b ) { if ( a [ 'key' ] < b [ 'key' ]) return - 1 if ( a [ 'key' ] > b [ 'key' ]) return 1 return 0 }) const users = [ { name : 'Asabeneh' , age : 150 }, { name : 'Brook' , age : 50 }, { name : 'Eyob' , age : 100 }, { name : 'Elias' , age : 22 }, ] users . sort (( a , b ) => { if ( a . age < b . age ) return - 1 if ( a . age > b . age ) return 1 return 0 }) console . log ( users ) // sorted ascending // [{\u2026}, {\u2026}, {\u2026}, {\u2026}] \ud83c\udf15 You are doing great.Never give up because great things take time. You have just completed day 9 challenges and you are 9 steps a head in to your way to greatness. Now do some exercises for your brain and for your muscle. \ud83d\udcbb Exercises Exercises: Level 1 const countries = [ 'Finland' , 'Sweden' , 'Denmark' , 'Norway' , 'IceLand' ] const names = [ 'Asabeneh' , 'Mathias' , 'Elias' , 'Brook' ] const numbers = [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 ] const products = [ { product : 'banana' , price : 3 }, { product : 'mango' , price : 6 }, { product : 'potato' , price : ' ' }, { product : 'avocado' , price : 8 }, { product : 'coffee' , price : 10 }, { product : 'tea' , price : '' }, ] Explain the difference between forEach, map, filter, and reduce . Define a callback function before you use it in forEach, map, filter or reduce. Use forEach to console.log each country in the countries array. Use forEach to console.log each name in the names array. Use forEach to console.log each number in the numbers array. Use map to create a new array by changing each country to uppercase in the countries array. Use map to create an array of countries length from countries array. Use map to create a new array by changing each number to square in the numbers array Use map to change to each name to uppercase in the names array Use map to map the products array to its corresponding prices. Use filter to filter out countries containing land . Use filter to filter out countries having six character. Use filter to filter out countries containing six letters and more in the country array. Use filter to filter out country start with 'E'; Use filter to filter out only prices with values. Declare a function called getStringLists which takes an array as a parameter and then returns an array only with string items. Use reduce to sum all the numbers in the numbers array. Use reduce to concatenate all the countries and to produce this sentence: Estonia, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, and IceLand are north European countries Explain the difference between some and every Use some to check if some names' length greater than seven in names array Use every to check if all the countries contain the word land Explain the difference between find and findIndex . Use find to find the first country containing only six letters in the countries array Use findIndex to find the position of the first country containing only six letters in the countries array Use findIndex to find the position of Norway if it doesn't exist in the array you will get -1. Use findIndex to find the position of Russia if it doesn't exist in the array you will get -1. Exercises: Level 2 Find the total price of products by chaining two or more array iterators(eg. arr.map(callback).filter(callback).reduce(callback)) Find the sum of price of products using only reduce reduce(callback)) Declare a function called categorizeCountries which returns an array of countries which have some common pattern(you find the countries array in this repository as countries.js(eg 'land', 'ia', 'island','stan')). Create a function which return an array of objects, which is the letter and the number of times the letter use to start with a name of a country. Declare a getFirstTenCountries function and return an array of ten countries. Use different functional programming to work on the countries.js array Declare a getLastTenCountries function which which returns the last ten countries in the countries array. Find out which letter is used many times as initial for a country name from the countries array (eg. Finland, Fiji, France etc) Exercises: Level 3 Use the countries information, in the data folder. Sort countries by name, by capital, by population *** Find the 10 most spoken languages: // Your output should look like this console . log ( mostSpokenLanguages ( countries , 10 )) [ { country : 'English' , count : 91 }, { country : 'French' , count : 45 }, { country : 'Arabic' , count : 25 }, { country : 'Spanish' , count : 24 }, { country : 'Russian' , count : 9 }, { country : 'Portuguese' , count : 9 }, { country : 'Dutch' , count : 8 }, { country : 'German' , count : 7 }, { country : 'Chinese' , count : 5 }, { country : 'Swahili' , count : 4 } ] // Your output should look like this console . log ( mostSpokenLanguages ( countries , 3 )) [ { country : 'English' , count : 91 }, { country : 'French' , count : 45 }, { country : 'Arabic' , count : 25 }, ] ``` *** Use countries_data.js file create a function which create the ten most populated countries console . log ( mostPopulatedCountries ( countries , 10 )) [ { country : 'China' , population : 1377422166 }, { country : 'India' , population : 1295210000 }, { country : 'United States of America' , population : 323947000 }, { country : 'Indonesia' , population : 258705000 }, { country : 'Brazil' , population : 206135893 }, { country : 'Pakistan' , population : 194125062 }, { country : 'Nigeria' , population : 186988000 }, { country : 'Bangladesh' , population : 161006790 }, { country : 'Russian Federation' , population : 146599183 }, { country : 'Japan' , population : 126960000 } ] console . log ( mostPopulatedCountries ( countries , 3 )) [ { country : 'China' , population : 1377422166 }, { country : 'India' , population : 1295210000 }, { country : 'United States of America' , population : 323947000 } ] ``` *** Try to develop a program which calculate measure of central tendency of a sample(mean, median, mode) and measure of variability(range, variance, standard deviation). In addition to those measures find the min, max, count, percentile, and frequency distribution of the sample.

Define a callback function before you use it in forEach, map, filter or reduce. Use forEach to console.log each country in the countries array. Use forEach to console.log each name in the names array. Use forEach to console.log each number in the numbers array. Use map to create a new array by changing each country to uppercase in the countries array. Use map to create an array of countries length from countries array. Use map to create a new array by changing each number to square in the numbers array Use map to change to each name to uppercase in the names array Use map to map the products array to its corresponding prices. Use filter to filter out countries containing land . Use filter to filter out countries having six character. Use filter to filter out countries containing six letters and more in the country array. Use filter to filter out country start with 'E'; Use filter to filter out only prices with values. Declare a function called getStringLists which takes an array as a parameter and then returns an array only with string items. Use reduce to sum all the numbers in the numbers array. Use reduce to concatenate all the countries and to produce this sentence: Estonia, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, and IceLand are north European countries Explain the difference between some and every Use some to check if some names' length greater than seven in names array Use every to check if all the countries contain the word land Explain the difference between find and findIndex . Use find to find the first country containing only six letters in the countries array Use findIndex to find the position of the first country containing only six letters in the countries array Use findIndex to find the position of Norway if it doesn't exist in the array you will get -1.

A RegExp can be used to check if some pattern exists in a different data types. To use RegExp in JavaScript either we use RegExp constructor or we can declare a RegExp pattern using two forward slashes followed by a flag. We can create a pattern in two ways. To declare a string we use a single quote, double quote a backtick to declare a regular expression we use two forward slashes and an optional flag. The flag could be g, i, m, s, u or y. RegExp parameters A regular expression takes two parameters. One required search pattern and an optional flag. Pattern A pattern could be a text or any form of pattern which some sort of similarity. For instance the word spam in an email could be a pattern we are interested to look for in an email or a phone number format number might be our interest to look for. Flags Flags are optional parameters in a regular expression which determine the type of searching. Let us see some of the flags: g: a global flag which means looking for a pattern in whole text i: case insensitive flag(it searches for both lowercase and uppercase) m: multiline Creating a pattern with RegExp Constructor Declaring regular expression without global flag and case insensitive flag. // without flag let pattern = 'love' let regEx = new RegExp ( pattern ) Declaring regular expression with global flag and case insensitive flag. let pattern = 'love' let flag = 'gi' let regEx = new RegExp ( pattern , flag ) Declaring a regex pattern using RegExp object. Writing the pattern and the flag inside the RegExp constructor let regEx = new RegExp ( 'love' , 'gi' ) Creating a pattern without RegExp Constructor Declaring regular expression with global flag and case insensitive flag. let regEx = /love/gi The above regular expression is the same as the one which we created with RegExp constructor let regEx = new RegExp ( 'love' , 'gi' ) RegExpp Object Methods Let us see some of RegExp methods Testing for a match test() :Tests for a match in a string.

Absolute beginners usually do not know which to use: console.log(), document.write() or document.getElementById. We use console object methods to show output on the browser console and we use document.write to show output on the browser document(view port). Both methods used only for testing and debugging purposes. The console method is the most popular testing and debugging tool on the browser. We use document.getElementById() when we like to interact with DOM try using JavaScript. We will cover DOM in another section. In addition to the famous, console.log() method, the console provides other more methods. console.log() We use console.log() to show output on the browser console. We can substitute values and also we can style the logging out put using %c. Showing output on browser console console . log ( '30 Days of JavaScript' ) 30 Days of JavaScript Substitution console . log ( '%d %s of JavaScript' , 30 , 'Days' ) 30 Days of JavaScript CSS We can style logging message using css. Copy the following code and paste it on browser console to see the result. console . log ( '%c30 Days Of JavaScript' , 'color:green' ) // log output is green console . log ( '%c30 Days%c %cOf%c %cJavaScript%c' , 'color:green' , '' , 'color:red' , '' , 'color:yellow' ) // log output green red and yellow text console.warn() We use console.warn() to give warning on browser. For instance to inform or warn deprecation of version of a package or bad practices. Copy the following code and paste it on browser console to see warning messages. console . warn ( 'This is a warning' ) console . warn ( 'You are using React. Do not touch the DOM. Virtual DOM will take care of handling the DOM!' ) console . warn ( 'Warning is different from error' ) console.error() The console.error() method shows an error messages. console . error ( 'This is an error message' ) console . error ( 'We all make mistakes' ) console.table() The console.table() method display data as a table on the console. Displays tabular data as a table. The console.table() takes one required argument data, which must be an array or an object, and one additional optional parameter columns. Let us first start with a simple array. The code below displays a table with two columns. An index column to display the index and value column to display the names const names = [ 'Asabeneh' , 'Brook' , 'David' , 'John' ] console . table ( names ) Let us also check the result of an object. This creates table with two columns:an index column containing the keys and a value column contain the values of the object. const user = { name : 'Asabeneh' , title : 'Programmer' , country : 'Finland' , city : 'Helsinki' , age : 250 } console . table ( user ) Check the rest of the examples by copying and paste on the browser console. const countries = [ [ 'Finland' , 'Helsinki' ], [ 'Sweden' , 'Stockholm' ], [ 'Norway' , 'Oslo' ] ] console . table ( countries ) const users = [ { name : 'Asabeneh' , title : 'Programmer' , country : 'Finland' , city : 'Helsinki' , age : 250 }, { name : 'Eyob' , title : 'Teacher' , country : 'Sweden' , city : 'London' , age : 25 }, { name : 'Asab' , title : 'Instructor' , country : 'Norway' , city : 'Oslo' , age : 22 }, { name : 'Matias' , title : 'Developer' , country : 'Denmark' , city : 'Copenhagen' , age : 28 } ] console . table ( users ) console.time() Starts a timer you can use to track how long an operation takes. You give each timer a unique name, and may have up to 10,000 timers running on a given page. When you call console.timeEnd() with the same name, the browser will output the time, in milliseconds, that elapsed since the timer was started. const countries = [ [ 'Finland' , 'Helsinki' ], [ 'Sweden' , 'Stockholm' ], [ 'Norway' , 'Oslo' ] ] console . time ( 'Regular for loop' ) for ( let i = 0 ; i < countries . length ; i ++ ) { console . log ( countries [ i ][ 0 ], countries [ i ][ 1 ]) } console . timeEnd ( 'Regular for loop' ) console . time ( 'for of loop' ) for ( const [ name , city ] of countries ) { console . log ( name , city ) } console . timeEnd ( 'for of loop' ) console . time ( 'forEach loop' ) countries . forEach (([ name , city ]) => { console . log ( name , city ) }) console . timeEnd ( 'forEach loop' ) Finland Helsinki Sweden Stockholm Norway Oslo Regular for loop: 0 .34716796875ms Finland Helsinki Sweden Stockholm Norway Oslo for of loop: 0 .26806640625ms Finland Helsinki Sweden Stockholm Norway Oslo forEach loop: 0 .358154296875ms According the above output the regular for loop is slower than for of or forEach loop. console.info() It displays information message on browser console. console . info ( '30 Days Of JavaScript challenge is trending on Github' ) console . info ( '30 Days Of fullStack challenge might be released' ) console . info ( '30 Days Of HTML and CSS challenge might be released' ) console.assert() The console.assert() methods writes an error message to the console if the assertion is false. If the assertion is true, nothing happens. The first parameter is an assertion expression. If this expression is false, an Assertion failed error message will be displayed. console . assert ( 4 > 3 , '4 is greater than 3' ) // no result console . assert ( 3 > 4 , '3 is not greater than 4' ) // Assertion failed: 3 is not greater than 4 for ( let i = 0 ; i <= 10 ; i += 1 ) { let errorMessage = ` ${ i } is not even` console . log ( 'the # is ' + i ) console . assert ( i % 2 === 0 , { number : i , errorMessage : errorMessage }) } console.group() The console.group() can help to group different log groups. Copy the following code and paste it on browser console to the groups. const names = [ 'Asabeneh' , 'Brook' , 'David' , 'John' ] const countries = [ [ 'Finland' , 'Helsinki' ], [ 'Sweden' , 'Stockholm' ], [ 'Norway' , 'Oslo' ] ] const user = { name : 'Asabeneh' , title : 'Programmer' , country : 'Finland' , city : 'Helsinki' , age : 250 } const users = [ { name : 'Asabeneh' , title : 'Programmer' , country : 'Finland' , city : 'Helsinki' , age : 250 }, { name : 'Eyob' , title : 'Teacher' , country : 'Sweden' , city : 'London' , age : 25 }, { name : 'Asab' , title : 'Instructor' , country : 'Norway' , city : 'Oslo' , age : 22 }, { name : 'Matias' , title : 'Developer' , country : 'Denmark' , city : 'Copenhagen' , age : 28 } ] console . group ( 'Names' ) console . log ( names ) console . groupEnd () console . group ( 'Countries' ) console . log ( countries ) console . groupEnd () console . group ( 'Users' ) console . log ( user ) console . log ( users ) console . groupEnd () console.count() It prints the number of times the console.count() is called. It takes a string label parameter. It is very helpful to count the number of times a function is called. In the following example, the console.count() method will run three times const func = () => { console . count ( 'Function has been called' ) } func () func () func () Function has been called: 1 Function has been called: 2 Function has been called: 3 console.clear() The console.clear() cleans the browser console. \ud83c\udf15 Keep up the good work.

Some times you will get a runtime error when you try to access an undefined variable or call undefined function etc. JavaScript similar to python or Java provides an error-handling mechanism to catch runtime errors using try-catch-finally block. try { // code that may throw an error } catch ( err ) { // code to be executed if an error occurs } finally { // code to be executed regardless of an error occurs or not } try : wrap suspicious code that may throw an error in try block.The try statement allows us to define a block of code to be tested for errors while it is being executed. catch : write code to do something in catch block when an error occurs. The catch block can have parameters that will give you error information. Catch block is used to log an error or display specific messages to the user. finally : finally block will always be executed regardless of the occurrence of an error. The finally block can be used to complete the remaining task or reset variables that might have changed before error occurred in try block.

Everything in JavScript is an object, with its properties and methods. We create class to create an object. A Class is like an object constructor, or a \"blueprint\" for creating objects. We instantiate a class to create an object. The class defines attributes and the behavior of the object, while the object, on the other hand, represents the class. Once we create a class we can create object from it whenever we want. Creating an object from a class is called class instantiation. In the object section, we saw how to create an object literal. Object literal is a singleton. If we want to get a similar object , we have to write it. However, class allows to create many objects. This helps to reduce amount of code and repetition of code. Defining a classes To define a class in JavaScript we need the keyword class , the name of a class in CamelCase and block code(two curly brackets). Let us create a class name Person. // syntax class ClassName { // code goes here } Example: class Person { // code goes here } We have created an Person class but it does not have any thing inside. Class Instantiation Instantiation class means creating an object from a class. We need the keyword new and we call the name of the class after the word new. Let us create a dog object from our Person class. class Person { // code goes here } const person = new Person () console . log ( person ) Person {} As you can see, we have created a person object. Since the class did not have any properties yet the object is also empty. Let use the class constructor to pass different properties for the class. Class Constructor The constructor is a builtin function which allows as to create a blueprint for our object. The constructor function starts with a keyword constructor followed by a parenthesis. Inside the parenthesis we pass the properties of the object as parameter. We use the this keyword to attach the constructor parameters with the class. The following Person class constructor has firstName and lastName property. These properties are attached to the Person class using this keyword. This refers to the class itself. class Person { constructor ( firstName , lastName ) { console . log ( this ) // Check the output from here this . firstName = firstName this . lastName = lastName } } const person = new Person () console . log ( person ) Person { firstName: undefined, lastName:undefined } All the keys of the object are undefined. When ever we instantiate we should pass the value of the properties. Let us pass value at this time when we instantiate the class. class Person { constructor ( firstName , lastName ) { this . firstName = firstName this . lastName = lastName } } const person1 = new Person ( 'Asabeneh' , 'Yetayeh' ) console . log ( person1 ) Person { firstName: \"Asabeneh\" , lastName: \"Yetayeh\" } As we have stated at the very beginning that once we create a class we can create many object using the class. Now, let us create many person objects using the Person class. class Person { constructor ( firstName , lastName ) { console . log ( this ) // Check the output from here this . firstName = firstName this . lastName = lastName } } const person1 = new Person ( 'Asabeneh' , 'Yetayeh' ) const person2 = new Person ( 'Lidiya' , 'Tekle' ) const person3 = new Person ( 'Abraham' , 'Yetayeh' ) console . log ( person1 ) console . log ( person2 ) console . log ( person3 ) Person { firstName: \"Asabeneh\" , lastName: \"Yetayeh\" } Person { firstName: \"Lidiya\" , lastName: \"Tekle\" } Person { firstName: \"Abraham\" , lastName: \"Yetayeh\" } Using the class Person we created three persons object. As you can see our class did not many properties let us add more properties to the class. class Person { constructor ( firstName , lastName , age , country , city ) { console . log ( this ) // Check the output from here this . firstName = firstName this . lastName = lastName this . age = age this . country = country this . city = city } } const person1 = new Person ( 'Asabeneh' , 'Yetayeh' , 250 , 'Finland' , 'Helsinki' ) console . log ( person1 ) Person { firstName: \"Asabeneh\" , lastName: \"Yetayeh\" , age: 250 , country: \"Finland\" , city: \"Helsinki\" } Default values with constructor The constructor function properties may have a default value like other regular functions. class Person { constructor ( firstName = 'Asabeneh' , lastName = 'Yetayeh' , age = 250 , country = 'Finland' , city = 'Helsinki' ) { this . firstName = firstName this . lastName = lastName this . age = age this . country = country this . city = city } } const person1 = new Person () // it will take the default values const person2 = new Person ( 'Lidiya' , 'Tekle' , 28 , 'Finland' , 'Espoo' ) console . log ( person1 ) console . log ( person2 ) Person { firstName: \"Asabeneh\" , lastName: \"Yetayeh\" , age: 250 , country: \"Finland\" , city: \"Helsinki\" } Person { firstName: \"Lidiya\" , lastName: \"Tekle\" , age: 28 , country: \"Finland\" , city: \"Espoo\" } Class methods The constructor inside a class is a builtin function which allow us to create a blueprint for the object. In a class we can create class methods. Methods are JavaScript functions inside the class. Let us create some class methods. class Person { constructor ( firstName , lastName , age , country , city ) { this . firstName = firstName this . lastName = lastName this . age = age this . country = country this . city = city } getFullName () { const fullName = this . firstName + ' ' + this . lastName return fullName } } const person1 = new Person ( 'Asabeneh' , 'Yetayeh' , 250 , 'Finland' , 'Helsinki' ) const person2 = new Person ( 'Lidiya' , 'Tekle' , 28 , 'Finland' , 'Espoo' ) console . log ( person1 . getFullName ()) console . log ( person2 . getFullName ()) Asabeneh Yetayeh test.js:19 Lidiya Tekle Properties with initial value When we create a class for some properties we may have an initial value. For instance if you are playing a game, you starting score will be zero. So, we may have a starting score or score which is zero. In other way, we may have an initial skill and we will acquire some skill after some time. class Person { constructor ( firstName , lastName , age , country , city ) { this . firstName = firstName this . lastName = lastName this . age = age this . country = country this . city = city this . score = 0 this . skills = [] } getFullName () { const fullName = this . firstName + ' ' + this . lastName return fullName } } const person1 = new Person ( 'Asabeneh' , 'Yetayeh' , 250 , 'Finland' , 'Helsinki' ) const person2 = new Person ( 'Lidiya' , 'Tekle' , 28 , 'Finland' , 'Espoo' ) console . log ( person1 . score ) console . log ( person2 . score ) console . log ( person1 . skills ) console . log ( person2 . skills ) 0 0 [] [] A method could be regular method or a getter or a setter. Let us see, getter and setter. getter The get method allow us to access value from the object. We write a get method using keyword get followed by a function. Instead of accessing properties directly from the object we use getter to get the value. See the example bellow class Person { constructor ( firstName , lastName , age , country , city ) { this . firstName = firstName this . lastName = lastName this . age = age this . country = country this . city = city this . score = 0 this . skills = [] } getFullName () { const fullName = this . firstName + ' ' + this . lastName return fullName } get getScore () { return this . score } get getSkills () { return this . skills } } const person1 = new Person ( 'Asabeneh' , 'Yetayeh' , 250 , 'Finland' , 'Helsinki' ) const person2 = new Person ( 'Lidiya' , 'Tekle' , 28 , 'Finland' , 'Espoo' ) console . log ( person1 . getScore ) // We do not need parenthesis to call a getter method console . log ( person2 . getScore ) console . log ( person1 . getSkills ) console . log ( person2 . getSkills ) 0 0 [] [] setter The setter method allow us to modify the value of certain properties. We write a setter method using keyword set followed by a function. See the example bellow. class Person { constructor ( firstName , lastName , age , country , city ) { this . firstName = firstName this . lastName = lastName this . age = age this . country = country this . city = city this . score = 0 this . skills = [] } getFullName () { const fullName = this . firstName + ' ' + this . lastName return fullName } get getScore () { return this . score } get getSkills () { return this . skills } set setScore ( score ) { this . score += score } set setSkill ( skill ) { this . skills . push ( skill ) } } const person1 = new Person ( 'Asabeneh' , 'Yetayeh' , 250 , 'Finland' , 'Helsinki' ) const person2 = new Person ( 'Lidiya' , 'Tekle' , 28 , 'Finland' , 'Espoo' ) person1 . setScore = 1 person1 . setSkill = 'HTML' person1 . setSkill = 'CSS' person1 . setSkill = 'JavaScript' person2 . setScore = 1 person2 . setSkill = 'Planning' person2 . setSkill = 'Managing' person2 . setSkill = 'Organizing' console . log ( person1 . score ) console . log ( person2 . score ) console . log ( person1 . skills ) console . log ( person2 . skills ) 1 1 [ \"HTML\" , \"CSS\" , \"JavaScript\" ] [ \"Planning\" , \"Managing\" , \"Organizing\" ] Do not be puzzled by the difference between regular method and a getter. If you know how to make a regular method you are good. Let us add regular method called getPersonInfo in the Person class. class Person { constructor ( firstName , lastName , age , country , city ) { this . firstName = firstName this . lastName = lastName this . age = age this . country = country this . city = city this . score = 0 this . skills = [] } getFullName () { const fullName = this . firstName + ' ' + this . lastName return fullName } get getScore () { return this . score } get getSkills () { return this . skills } set setScore ( score ) { this . score += score } set setSkill ( skill ) { this . skills . push ( skill ) } getPersonInfo () { let fullName = this . getFullName () let skills = this . skills . length > 0 && this . skills . slice ( 0 , this . skills . length - 1 ). join ( ', ' ) + ` and ${ this . skills [ this . skills . length - 1 ] } ` let formattedSkills = skills ? `He knows ${ skills } ` : '' let info = ` ${ fullName } is ${ this . age } . He lives ${ this . city } , ${ this . country } . ${ formattedSkills } ` return info } } const person1 = new Person ( 'Asabeneh' , 'Yetayeh' , 250 , 'Finland' , 'Helsinki' ) const person2 = new Person ( 'Lidiya' , 'Tekle' , 28 , 'Finland' , 'Espoo' ) const person3 = new Person ( 'John' , 'Doe' , 50 , 'Mars' , 'Mars city' ) person1 . setScore = 1 person1 . setSkill = 'HTML' person1 . setSkill = 'CSS' person1 . setSkill = 'JavaScript' person2 . setScore = 1 person2 . setSkill = 'Planning' person2 . setSkill = 'Managing' person2 . setSkill = 'Organizing' console . log ( person1 . getScore ) console . log ( person2 . getScore ) console . log ( person1 . getSkills ) console . log ( person2 . getSkills ) console . log ( person3 . getSkills ) console . log ( person1 . getPersonInfo ()) console . log ( person2 . getPersonInfo ()) console . log ( person3 . getPersonInfo ()) 1 1 [ \"HTML\" , \"CSS\" , \"JavaScript\" ] [ \"Planning\" , \"Managing\" , \"Organizing\" ] [] Asabeneh Yetayeh is 250 . He lives Helsinki, Finland. He knows HTML, CSS and JavaScript Lidiya Tekle is 28 . He lives Espoo, Finland. He knows Planning, Managing and Organizing John Doe is 50 . He lives Mars city, Mars. Static method The static keyword defines a static method for a class. Static methods are not called on instances of the class. Instead, they are called on the class itself. These are often utility functions, such as functions to create or clone objects. An example of static method is Date.now() . The now method is called directly from the class. class Person { constructor ( firstName , lastName , age , country , city ) { this . firstName = firstName this . lastName = lastName this . age = age this . country = country this . city = city this . score = 0 this . skills = [] } getFullName () { const fullName = this . firstName + ' ' + this . lastName return fullName } get getScore () { return this . score } get getSkills () { return this . skills } set setScore ( score ) { this . score += score } set setSkill ( skill ) { this . skills . push ( skill ) } getPersonInfo () { let fullName = this . getFullName () let skills = this . skills . length > 0 && this . skills . slice ( 0 , this . skills . length - 1 ). join ( ', ' ) + ` and ${ this . skills [ this . skills . length - 1 ] } ` let formattedSkills = skills ? `He knows ${ skills } ` : '' let info = ` ${ fullName } is ${ this . age } . He lives ${ this . city } , ${ this . country } . ${ formattedSkills } ` return info } static favoriteSkill () { const skills = [ 'HTML' , 'CSS' , 'JS' , 'React' , 'Python' , 'Node' ] const index = Math . floor ( Math . random () * skills . length ) return skills [ index ] } static showDateTime () { let now = new Date () let year = now . getFullYear () let month = now . getMonth () + 1 let date = now . getDate () let hours = now . getHours () let minutes = now . getMinutes () if ( hours < 10 ) { hours = '0' + hours } if ( minutes < 10 ) { minutes = '0' + minutes } let dateMonthYear = date + '.' + month + '.' + year let time = hours + ':' + minutes let fullTime = dateMonthYear + ' ' + time return fullTime } } console . log ( Person . favoriteSkill ()) console . log ( Person . showDateTime ()) Node 15 .1.2020 23 :56 The static methods are methods which can be used as utility functions. Inheritance Using inheritance we can access all the properties and the methods of the parent class. This reduces repetition of code. If you remember, we have a Person parent class and we will create children from it. Our children class could be student, teach etc. // syntax class ChildClassName extends { // code goes here } Let us create a Student child class from Person parent class. class Student extends Person { saySomething () { console . log ( 'I am a child of the person class' ) } } const s1 = new Student ( 'Asabeneh' , 'Yetayeh' , 'Finland' , 250 , 'Helsinki' ) console . log ( s1 ) console . log ( s1 . saySomething ()) console . log ( s1 . getFullName ()) console . log ( s1 . getPersonInfo ()) Student { firstName: \"Asabeneh\" , lastName: \"Yetayeh\" , age: \"Finland\" , country: 250 , city: \"Helsinki\" , \u2026 } I am a child of the person class Asabeneh Yetayeh Student { firstName: \"Asabeneh\" , lastName: \"Yetayeh\" , age: \"Finland\" , country: 250 , city: \"Helsinki\" , \u2026 } Asabeneh Yetayeh is Finland. He lives Helsinki, 250 . Overriding methods As you can see, we manage to access all the methods in the Person Class and we used it in the Student child class. We can customize the parent methods, we can add additional properties to a child class. If we want to customize, the methods and if we want to add extra properties, we need to use the constructor function the child class too. Inside the constructor function we call the super() function to access all the properties from the parent class. The Person class didn't have gender but now let us give gender property for the child class, Student. If the same method name used in the child class, the parent method will be overridden. class Student extends Person { constructor ( firstName , lastName , age , country , city , gender ) { super ( firstName , lastName , age , country , city ) this . gender = gender } saySomething () { console . log ( 'I am a child of the person class' ) } getPersonInfo () { let fullName = this . getFullName () let skills = this . skills . length > 0 && this . skills . slice ( 0 , this . skills . length - 1 ). join ( ', ' ) + ` and ${ this . skills [ this . skills . length - 1 ] } ` let formattedSkills = skills ? `He knows ${ skills } ` : '' let pronoun = this . gender == 'Male' ? 'He' : 'She' let info = ` ${ fullName } is ${ this . age } . ${ pronoun } lives in ${ this . city } , ${ this . country } . ${ formattedSkills } ` return info } } const s1 = new Student ( 'Asabeneh' , 'Yetayeh' , 250 , 'Finland' , 'Helsinki' , 'Male' ) const s2 = new Student ( 'Lidiya' , 'Tekle' , 28 , 'Finland' , 'Helsinki' , 'Female' ) s1 . setScore = 1 s1 . setSkill = 'HTML' s1 . setSkill = 'CSS' s1 . setSkill = 'JavaScript' s2 . setScore = 1 s2 . setSkill = 'Planning' s2 . setSkill = 'Managing' s2 . setSkill = 'Organizing' console . log ( s1 ) console . log ( s1 . saySomething ()) console . log ( s1 . getFullName ()) console . log ( s1 . getPersonInfo ()) console . log ( s2 . saySomething ()) console . log ( s2 . getFullName ()) console . log ( s2 . getPersonInfo ()) Student { firstName: \"Asabeneh\" , lastName: \"Yetayeh\" , age: 250 , country: \"Finland\" , city: \"Helsinki\" , \u2026 } Student { firstName: \"Lidiya\" , lastName: \"Tekle\" , age: 28 , country: \"Finland\" , city: \"Helsinki\" , \u2026 } I am a child of the person class Asabeneh Yetayeh Student { firstName: \"Asabeneh\" , lastName: \"Yetayeh\" , age: 250 , country: \"Finland\" , city: \"Helsinki\" , \u2026 } Asabeneh Yetayeh is 250 . He lives in Helsinki, Finland. He knows HTML, CSS and JavaScript I am a child of the person class Lidiya Tekle Student { firstName: \"Lidiya\" , lastName: \"Tekle\" , age: 28 , country: \"Finland\" , city: \"Helsinki\" , \u2026 } Lidiya Tekle is 28 . She lives in Helsinki, Finland. He knows Planning, Managing and Organizing Now, the getPersonInfo method has been overridden and it identifies if the person is male or female. \ud83c\udf15 You are excelling.

The JSON syntax is derived from JavaScript object notation syntax, but the JSON format is text or string only. JSON is a light weight data format for storing and transporting. JSON is mostly used when data is sent from a server to a client. JSON is an easier-to-use alternative to XML. Example: { \"users\" : [ { \"firstName\" : \"Asabeneh\" , \"lastName\" : \"Yetayeh\" , \"age\" : 250 , \"email\" : \"asab@asb.com\" }, { \"firstName\" : \"Alex\" , \"lastName\" : \"James\" , \"age\" : 25 , \"email\" : \"alex@alex.com\" }, { \"firstName\" : \"Lidiya\" , \"lastName\" : \"Tekle\" , \"age\" : 28 , \"email\" : \"lidiya@lidiya.com\" } ] } The above JSON example is not much different from a normal object. Then, what is the difference ? The difference is the key of a JSON object should be with double quotes or it should be a string. JavaScript Object and JSON are very similar that we can change JSON to Object and Object to JSON. Let us see the above example in more detail, it starts with a curly bracket. Inside the curly bracket, there is \"users\" key which has a value array. Inside the array we have different objects and each objects has keys, each keys has to have double quotes. For instance, we use \"firstNaMe\" instead of just firstName, however in object we use keys without double quotes. This is the major difference between an object and a JSON. Let's see more examples about JSON. Example: { \"Alex\" : { \"email\" : \"alex@alex.com\" , \"skills\" : [ \"HTML\" , \"CSS\" , \"JavaScript\" ], \"age\" : 20 , \"isLoggedIn\" : false , \"points\" : 30 }, \"Asab\" : { \"email\" : \"asab@asab.com\" , \"skills\" : [ \"HTML\" , \"CSS\" , \"JavaScript\" , \"Redux\" , \"MongoDB\" , \"Express\" , \"React\" , \"Node\" ], \"age\" : 25 , \"isLoggedIn\" : false , \"points\" : 50 }, \"Brook\" : { \"email\" : \"daniel@daniel.com\" , \"skills\" : [ \"HTML\" , \"CSS\" , \"JavaScript\" , \"React\" , \"Redux\" ], \"age\" : 30 , \"isLoggedIn\" : true , \"points\" : 50 }, \"Daniel\" : { \"email\" : \"daniel@alex.com\" , \"skills\" : [ \"HTML\" , \"CSS\" , \"JavaScript\" , \"Python\" ], \"age\" : 20 , \"isLoggedIn\" : false , \"points\" : 40 }, \"John\" : { \"email\" : \"john@john.com\" , \"skills\" : [ \"HTML\" , \"CSS\" , \"JavaScript\" , \"React\" , \"Redux\" , \"Node.js\" ], \"age\" : 20 , \"isLoggedIn\" : true , \"points\" : 50 }, \"Thomas\" : { \"email\" : \"thomas@thomas.com\" , \"skills\" : [ \"HTML\" , \"CSS\" , \"JavaScript\" , \"React\" ], \"age\" : 20 , \"isLoggedIn\" : false , \"points\" : 40 }, \"Paul\" : { \"email\" : \"paul@paul.com\" , \"skills\" : [ \"HTML\" , \"CSS\" , \"JavaScript\" , \"MongoDB\" , \"Express\" , \"React\" , \"Node\" ], \"age\" : 20 , \"isLoggedIn\" : false , \"points\" : 40 } } Converting JSON to JavaScript Object Mostly we fetch JSON data from HTTP response or from a file, but we can store the JSON as a string and we can change to Object for sake of demonstration. In JavaScript the keyword JSON has parse() and stringify() methods. When we want to change the JSON to an object we parse the JSON using JSON.parse() . When we want to change the object to JSON we use JSON.stringify() . JSON.parse() JSON . parse ( json [, reviver ]) // json or text , the data // reviver is an optional callback function /* JSON.parse(json, (key, value) => { }) */ const usersText = `{ \"users\":[ { \"firstName\":\"Asabeneh\", \"lastName\":\"Yetayeh\", \"age\":250, \"email\":\"asab@asb.com\" }, { \"firstName\":\"Alex\", \"lastName\":\"James\", \"age\":25, \"email\":\"alex@alex.com\" }, { \"firstName\":\"Lidiya\", \"lastName\":\"Tekle\", \"age\":28, \"email\":\"lidiya@lidiya.com\" } ] }` const usersObj = JSON . parse ( usersText , undefined , 4 ) console . log ( usersObj ) Using a reviver function with JSON.parse() To use the reviver function as a formatter, we put the keys we want to format first name and last name value. Let us say, we are interested to format the firstName and lastName of the JSON data . const usersText = `{ \"users\":[ { \"firstName\":\"Asabeneh\", \"lastName\":\"Yetayeh\", \"age\":250, \"email\":\"asab@asb.com\" }, { \"firstName\":\"Alex\", \"lastName\":\"James\", \"age\":25, \"email\":\"alex@alex.com\" }, { \"firstName\":\"Lidiya\", \"lastName\":\"Tekle\", \"age\":28, \"email\":\"lidiya@lidiya.com\" } ] }` const usersObj = JSON . parse ( usersText , ( key , value ) => { let newValue = typeof value == 'string' && key != 'email' ? value . toUpperCase () : value return newValue }) console . log ( usersObj ) The JSON.parse() is very handy to use. You do not have to pass optional parameter, you can just use it with the required parameter and you will achieve quite a lot. Converting Object to JSON When we want to change the object to JSON we use JSON.stringify() . The stringify method takes one required parameter and two optional parameters. The replacer is used as filter and the space is an indentations. If we do not want to filter out any of the keys from the object we can just pass undefined. JSON . stringify ( obj , replacer , space ) // json or text , the data // reviver is an optional callback function Let us convert the following object to a string. First let use keep all the keys and also let us have 4 space indentation. const users = { Alex : { email : 'alex@alex.com' , skills : [ 'HTML' , 'CSS' , 'JavaScript' ], age : 20 , isLoggedIn : false , points : 30 }, Asab : { email : 'asab@asab.com' , skills : [ 'HTML' , 'CSS' , 'JavaScript' , 'Redux' , 'MongoDB' , 'Express' , 'React' , 'Node' ], age : 25 , isLoggedIn : false , points : 50 }, Brook : { email : 'daniel@daniel.com' , skills : [ 'HTML' , 'CSS' , 'JavaScript' , 'React' , 'Redux' ], age : 30 , isLoggedIn : true , points : 50 }, Daniel : { email : 'daniel@alex.com' , skills : [ 'HTML' , 'CSS' , 'JavaScript' , 'Python' ], age : 20 , isLoggedIn : false , points : 40 }, John : { email : 'john@john.com' , skills : [ 'HTML' , 'CSS' , 'JavaScript' , 'React' , 'Redux' , 'Node.js' ], age : 20 , isLoggedIn : true , points : 50 }, Thomas : { email : 'thomas@thomas.com' , skills : [ 'HTML' , 'CSS' , 'JavaScript' , 'React' ], age : 20 , isLoggedIn : false , points : 40 }, Paul : { email : 'paul@paul.com' , skills : [ 'HTML' , 'CSS' , 'JavaScript' , 'MongoDB' , 'Express' , 'React' , 'Node' ], age : 20 , isLoggedIn : false , points : 40 } } const txt = JSON . stringify ( users , undefined , 4 ) console . log ( txt ) // text means JSON- because json is a string form of an object. { \"Alex\" : { \"email\" : \"alex@alex.com\" , \"skills\" : [ \"HTML\" , \"CSS\" , \"JavaScript\" ] , \"age\" : 20 , \"isLoggedIn\" : false, \"points\" : 30 } , \"Asab\" : { \"email\" : \"asab@asab.com\" , \"skills\" : [ \"HTML\" , \"CSS\" , \"JavaScript\" , \"Redux\" , \"MongoDB\" , \"Express\" , \"React\" , \"Node\" ] , \"age\" : 25 , \"isLoggedIn\" : false, \"points\" : 50 } , \"Brook\" : { \"email\" : \"daniel@daniel.com\" , \"skills\" : [ \"HTML\" , \"CSS\" , \"JavaScript\" , \"React\" , \"Redux\" ] , \"age\" : 30 , \"isLoggedIn\" : true, \"points\" : 50 } , \"Daniel\" : { \"email\" : \"daniel@alex.com\" , \"skills\" : [ \"HTML\" , \"CSS\" , \"JavaScript\" , \"Python\" ] , \"age\" : 20 , \"isLoggedIn\" : false, \"points\" : 40 } , \"John\" : { \"email\" : \"john@john.com\" , \"skills\" : [ \"HTML\" , \"CSS\" , \"JavaScript\" , \"React\" , \"Redux\" , \"Node.js\" ] , \"age\" : 20 , \"isLoggedIn\" : true, \"points\" : 50 } , \"Thomas\" : { \"email\" : \"thomas@thomas.com\" , \"skills\" : [ \"HTML\" , \"CSS\" , \"JavaScript\" , \"React\" ] , \"age\" : 20 , \"isLoggedIn\" : false, \"points\" : 40 } , \"Paul\" : { \"email\" : \"paul@paul.com\" , \"skills\" : [ \"HTML\" , \"CSS\" , \"JavaScript\" , \"MongoDB\" , \"Express\" , \"React\" , \"Node\" ] , \"age\" : 20 , \"isLoggedIn\" : false, \"points\" : 40 } } Using a Filter Array with JSON.stringify Now, lets use the replacer as a filter.

Before HTML5, application data had to be stored in cookies, included in every server request. Web storage is more secure, and large amounts of data can be stored locally, without affecting website performance. The data storage limit of cookies in many web browsers is about 4 KB per cookie. We Storages can store far larger data (at least 5MB) and never transferred to the server. All sites from the same or one origin can store and access the same data. The data being stored can be accessed using JavaScript, which gives you the ability to leverage client-side scripting to do many things that have traditionally involved server-side programming and relational databases. There are two Web Storage objects: sessionStorage localStorage localStorage is similar to sessionStorage, except that while data stored in localStorage has no expiration time, data stored in sessionStorage gets cleared when the page session ends \u2014 that is, when the page is closed. It should be noted that data stored in either localStorage or sessionStorage is specific to the protocol of the page. The keys and the values are always strings (note that, as with objects, integer keys will be automatically converted to strings). sessionStorage sessionStorage is only available within the browser tab or window session. It\u2019s designed to store data in a single web page session. That means if the window is closed the session data will be removed. Since sessionStorage and localStorage has similar methods, we will focus only on localStorage. localStorage The HTML5 localStorage is the para of the web storage API which is used to store data on the browser with no expiration data. The data will be available on the browser even after the browser is closed. localStorage is kept even between browser sessions. This means data is still available when the browser is closed and reopened, and also instantly between tabs and windows. Web Storage data is, in both cases, not available between different browsers. For example, storage objects created in Firefox cannot be accessed in Internet Explorer, exactly like cookies. There are five methods to work on local storage: setItem(), getItem(), removeItem(), clear(), key() Use case of Web Storages Some use case of Web Storages are store data temporarily saving products that the user places in his shopping cart data can be made available between page requests, multiple browser tabs, and also between browser sessions using localStorage can be used offline completely using localStorage Web Storage can be a great performance win when some static data is stored on the client to minimize the number of subsequent requests. Even images can be stored in strings using Base64 encoding. can be used for user authentication method For the examples mentioned above, it makes sense to use localStorage. You may be wondering, then, when we should use sessionStorage. In cases, we want to to get rid of the data as soon as the window is closed. Or, perhaps, if we do not want the application to interfere with the same application that\u2019s open in another window. These scenarios are served best with sessionStorage. Now, let us see how make use of these Web Storage APIs. HTML5 Web Storage Objects HTML web storage provides two objects for storing data on the client: window.localStorage - stores data with no expiration date window.sessionStorage - stores data for one session (data is lost when the browser tab is closed)Most modern browsers support Web Storage, however it is good to check browser support for localStorage and sessionStorage. Let us see the available methods for the Web Storage objects. Web Storage objects: localStorage - to display the localStorage object localStorage.clear() - to remove everything in the local storage localStorage.setItem() - to store data in the localStorage. It takes a key and a value parameters. localStorage.getItem() - to display data stored in the localStorage. It takes a key as a parameter. localStorage.removeItem() - to remove stored item form a localStorage. It takes key as a parameter. localStorage.key() - to display a data stored in a localStorage. It takes index as a parameter. Setting item to the localStorage When we set data to be stored in a localStorage, it will be stored as a string. If we are storing an array or an object, we should stringify it first to keep the format unless otherwise we lose the array structure or the object structure of the original data. We store data in the localStorage using the localStorage.setItem method. //syntax localStorage . setItem ( 'key' , 'value' ) Storing string in a localStorage localStorage . setItem ( 'firstName' , 'Asabeneh' ) // since the value is string we do not stringify it console . log ( localStorage ) Storage { firstName: 'Asabeneh' , length: 1 } Storing number in a local storage localStorage . setItem ( 'age' , 200 ) console . log ( localStorage ) Storage { age: '200' , firstName: 'Asabeneh' , length: 2 } Storing an array in a localStorage. If we are storing an array, an object or object array, we should stringify the object first. See the example below. const skills = [ 'HTML' , 'CSS' , 'JS' , 'React' ] //Skills array has to be stringified first to keep the format. const skillsJSON = JSON . stringify ( skills , undefined , 4 ) localStorage . setItem ( 'skills' , skillsJSON ) console . log ( localStorage ) Storage { age: '200' , firstName: 'Asabeneh' , skills: 'HTML,CSS,JS,React' , length: 3 } let skills = [ { tech : 'HTML' , level : 10 }, { tech : 'CSS' , level : 9 }, { tech : 'JS' , level : 8 }, { tech : 'React' , level : 9 }, { tech : 'Redux' , level : 10 }, { tech : 'Node' , level : 8 }, { tech : 'MongoDB' , level : 8 } ] let skillJSON = JSON . stringify ( skills ) localStorage . setItem ( 'skills' , skillJSON ) Storing an object in a localStorage. Before we storage objects to a localStorage, the object has to be stringified. const user = { firstName : 'Asabeneh' , age : 250 , skills : [ 'HTML' , 'CSS' , 'JS' , 'React' ] } const userText = JSON . stringify ( user , undefined , 4 ) localStorage . setItem ( 'user' , userText ) Getting item from localStorage We get data from the local storage using localStorage.getItem() method. //syntax localStorage . getItem ( 'key' ) let firstName = localStorage . getItem ( 'firstName' ) let age = localStorage . getItem ( 'age' ) let skills = localStorage . getItem ( 'skills' ) console . log ( firstName , age , skills ) 'Asabeneh' , '200' , '[' HTML ',' CSS ',' JS ',' React ']' As you can see the skill is in a string format. Let us use JSON.parse() to parse it to normal array. let skills = localStorage . getItem ( 'skills' ) let skillsObj = JSON . parse ( skills , undefined , 4 ) console . log ( skillsObj ) [ 'HTML' , 'CSS' , 'JS' , 'React' ] Clearing the localStorage The clear method, will clear everything stored in the local storage localStorage . clear () \ud83c\udf15 You are determined .Now, you knew a Web Storages and you knew how to store small data on client browsers.

If we keep the promise we make others happy but if we do not keep the promise, it may lead discontentment. Promise in JavaScript has something in common with the above examples. A Promise is a way to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript. It allows handlers with an asynchronous action's eventual success value or failure reason. This lets asynchronous methods return values like synchronous methods: instead of immediately returning the final value, the asynchronous method returns a promise to supply the value at some point in the future. A Promise is in one of these states: pending: initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected. fulfilled: meaning that the operation completed successfully. rejected: meaning that the operation failed. A pending promise can either be fulfilled with a value, or rejected with a reason (error). When either of these options happens, the associated handlers queued up by a promise's then method are called. (If the promise has already been fulfilled or rejected when a corresponding handler is attached, the handler will be called, so there is no race condition between an asynchronous operation completing and its handlers being attached.) As the Promise.prototype.then() and Promise.prototype.catch() methods return promises, they can be chained. Callbacks To understand promise very well let us understand callback first. Let's see the following callbacks. From the following code blocks you will notice, the difference between callback and promises. call back Let us see a callback function which can take two parameters. The first parameter is err and the second is result. If the err parameter is false, there will not be error other wise it will return an error. In this case the err has a value and it will return the err block. //Callback const doSomething = callback => { setTimeout (() => { const skills = [ 'HTML' , 'CSS' , 'JS' ] callback ( 'It did not go well' , skills ) }, 2000 ) } const callback = ( err , result ) => { if ( err ) { return console . log ( err ) } return console . log ( result ) } doSomething ( callback ) // after 2 seconds it will print It did not go well In this case the err is false and it will return the else block which is the result. const doSomething = callback => { setTimeout (() => { const skills = [ 'HTML' , 'CSS' , 'JS' ] callback ( false , skills ) }, 2000 ) } doSomething (( err , result ) => { if ( err ) { return console . log ( err ) } return console . log ( result ) }) // after 2 seconds it will print the skills [ \"HTML\" , \"CSS\" , \"JS\" ] Promise constructor We can create a promise using the Promise constructor. We can create a new promise using the key word new followed by the word Promise and followed by a parenthesis. Inside the parenthesis, it takes a callback function. The promise callback function has two parameters which are the resolve and reject functions. // syntax const promise = new Promise (( resolve , reject ) => { resolve ( 'success' ) reject ( 'failure' ) }) // Promise const doPromise = new Promise (( resolve , reject ) => { setTimeout (() => { const skills = [ 'HTML' , 'CSS' , 'JS' ] if ( skills . length > 0 ) { resolve ( skills ) } else { reject ( 'Something wrong has happened' ) } }, 2000 ) }) doPromise . then ( result => { console . log ( result ) }) . catch ( error => console . log ( error )) [ \"HTML\" , \"CSS\" , \"JS\" ] The above promise has been settled with resolve. Let us another example when the promise is settled with reject. // Promise const doPromise = new Promise (( resolve , reject ) => { setTimeout (() => { const skills = [ 'HTML' , 'CSS' , 'JS' ] if ( skills . includes ( 'Node' )) { resolve ( 'fullstack developer' ) } else { reject ( 'Something wrong has happened' ) } }, 2000 ) }) doPromise . then ( result => { console . log ( result ) }) . catch ( error => console . error ( error )) Something wrong has happened Fetch API The Fetch API provides an interface for fetching resources (including across the network). It will seem familiar to anyone who has used XMLHttpRequest, but the new API provides a more powerful and flexible feature set. In this challenge we will use fetch to request url and APIS. In addition to that let us see demonstrate use case of promises in accessing network resources using the fetch API. const url = 'https://restcountries.com/v2/all' // countries api fetch ( url ) . then ( response => response . json ()) // accessing the API data as JSON . then ( data => { // getting the data console . log ( data ) }) . catch ( error => console . error ( error )) // handling error if something wrong happens Async and Await Async and await is an elegant way to handle promises. It is easy to understand and it clean to write. const square = async function ( n ) { return n * n } square ( 2 ) Promise { <resolved>: 4 } The word async in front of a function means that function will return a promise. The above square function instead of a value it returns a promise. How do we access the value from the promise? To access the value from the promise, we will use the keyword await . const square = async function ( n ) { return n * n } const value = await square ( 2 ) console . log ( value ) 4 Now, as you can see from the above example writing async in front of a function create a promise and to get the value from a promise we use await. Async and await go together, one can not exist without the other. Let us fetch API data using both promise method and async and await method. promise const url = 'https://restcountries.com/v2/all' fetch ( url ) . then ( response => response . json ()) . then ( data => { console . log ( data ) }) . catch ( error => console . error ( error )) async and await const fetchData = async () => { try { const response = await fetch ( url ) const countries = await response . json () console . log ( countries ) } catch ( err ) { console . error ( err ) } } console . log ( '===== async and await' ) fetchData () \ud83c\udf15 You are real and you kept your promise and you reached to day 18.

If we keep the promise we make others happy but if we do not keep the promise, it may lead discontentment. Promise in JavaScript has something in common with the above examples. A Promise is a way to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript. It allows handlers with an asynchronous action's eventual success value or failure reason. This lets asynchronous methods return values like synchronous methods: instead of immediately returning the final value, the asynchronous method returns a promise to supply the value at some point in the future. A Promise is in one of these states: pending: initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected. fulfilled: meaning that the operation completed successfully. rejected: meaning that the operation failed. A pending promise can either be fulfilled with a value, or rejected with a reason (error). When either of these options happens, the associated handlers queued up by a promise's then method are called. (If the promise has already been fulfilled or rejected when a corresponding handler is attached, the handler will be called, so there is no race condition between an asynchronous operation completing and its handlers being attached.) As the Promise.prototype.then() and Promise.prototype.catch() methods return promises, they can be chained.","title":"Promise"},{"location":"18-day/#callbacks","text":"To understand promise very well let us understand callback first.

In this section, we will talk about JavaScript guides and how to write a clean code. JavaScript is a programming language and like human language it has syntax. The syntax of JavaScript has to be written following a certain style guideline for sake of convince and simplicity. Why we need style guide You have been coding alone for so long but now it seems to work in a team. It does not matter in anyway you write you code as long as it running, however when you work in team of 10 or 20 or more developer on one project and on the same code base, the code will be messy and hard to manage if there is no any guidelines to follow. You can develop your own guidelines and conventions or you can also adapt well developed guidelines. Let us the most common know guidelines. Most common JavaScript Style Guides Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide JavaScript Standard Style Guide Google JavaScript Style Guide Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide Airbnb has one of the most popular JavaScript style guides on the internet. It covers nearly every aspect of JavaScript as well and it is adopted by many developer and companies. You may checkout the Airbnb style guide . I would also recommend to try it. Their style is very easy to use and simple to understand. Standard JavaScript Style Guide This is guideline is not as popular as Airbnb but it worth to look at it. They removed the semicolon in their style guide . Google JavaScript Style Guide I do not say much about Googles guideline and I did not use rather I would suggest you to have a look from this link . JavaScript Coding Conventions In this challenge also we used the general JavaScript coding writing conventions and guides. Coding conventions are style guidelines for programming which are developed by an individual, a team or a company. Coding conventions helps: to write clean code to improve code readability to improve code re-useability and maintainability Coding conventions includes Naming and declaration rules for variables Naming and declaration rules for functions Rules for the use of white space, indentation, and comments Programming practices and principles Conventions use in 30DaysOfJavaScript In this challenge we follow the regular JavaScript convention but I added also my preference of writing. We used camelCase for variables and functions. All variable names start with a letter. We chose to use const for constants, arrays, objects and functions. In stead of double quote, we chose to use single quote or backtick. Single quote is becoming trendy. We also removed semicolons from our code but it is a matter of personal preference. Space around arithmetic operators, assignment operators and after comma Arrow function instead of function declaration Explicit return instead of implicit return if the function is one liner No trailing comma in the last value of an object We prefer this +=, -=, = /=, *= instead of the longer version When we use console.log() it is good to print with a tag string to identify from where the console is coming Variables let firstName = 'Asabeneh' let lastName = 'Yetayeh' let country = 'Finland' let city = 'Helsinki' const PI = Math . PI const gravity = 9.81 Arrays We chose to make array names plural names numbers countries languages skills fruits vegetables // arrays const names = [ 'Asabeneh' , 'Mathias' , 'Elias' , 'Brook' ] const numbers = [ 0 , 3.14 , 9.81 , 37 , 98.6 , 100 ] const countries = [ 'Finland' , 'Denmark' , 'Sweden' , 'Norway' , 'Iceland' ] const languages = [ 'Amharic' , 'Arabic' , 'English' , 'French' , 'Spanish' ] const skills = [ 'HTML' , 'CSS' , 'JavaScript' , 'React' , 'Python' ] const fruits = [ 'banana' , 'orange' , 'mango' , 'lemon' ] const vegetables = [ 'Tomato' , 'Potato' , 'Cabbage' , 'Onion' , 'Carrot' ] Functions By now you are very familiar function declaration, expression function, arrow function and anonymous function. In this challenge we tend to use arrow function instead of other functions. Arrow function is not a replacement for other functions. In addition, arrow functions and function declarations are not exactly the same. So you should know when to use and when not. I will cover the difference in detail in other sections. We will use explicit return instead of implicit return if the function is one liner // function which return full name of a person const printFullName = ( firstName , lastName ) => firstName + ' ' + lastName // function which calculates a square of a number const square = ( n ) => n * n // a function which generate random hexa colors const hexaColor = () => { const str = '0123456789abcdef' let hexa = '#' let index for ( let i = 0 ; i < 6 ; i ++ ) { index = Math . floor ( Math . random () * str . length ) hexa += str [ index ] } return hexa } // a function which shows date and time const showDateTime = () => { const now = new Date () const year = now . getFullYear () const month = now . getMonth () + 1 const date = now . getDate () let hours = now . getHours () let minutes = now . getMinutes () if ( hours < 10 ) { hours = '0' + hours } if ( minutes < 10 ) { minutes = '0' + minutes } const dateMonthYear = date + '.' + month + '.' + year const time = hours + ':' + minutes const fullTime = dateMonthYear + ' ' + time return fullTime } The new Dat().toLocaleString() can also be used to display current date time. The toLocaleString() methods takes different arguments. You may learn more about date and time from this link . Loops We coverer many types of loops in this challenges. The regular for loop, while loop, do while loop, for of loop, forEach loop and for in loop. Lets see how we use them: for ( let i = 0 ; i < n ; i ++ ){ console . log () } // declaring an array variable const names = [ 'Asabeneh' , 'Mathias' , 'Elias' , 'Brook' ] // iterating an array using regular for loop let len = names . length ; for ( let i = 0 ; i < len ; i ++ ){ console . log ( names [ i ]. toUpperCase ()) } // iterating an array using for of for ( const name of names ) { console . log ( name . toUpperCase ()) } // iterating array using forEach names . forEach (( name ) => name . toUpperCase ()) const person = { firstName : 'Asabeneh' , lastName : 'Yetayeh' , age : 250 , country : 'Finland' , city : 'Helsinki' , skills : [ 'HTML' , 'CSS' , 'JavaScript' , 'React' , 'Node' , 'MongoDB' , 'Python' , 'D3.js' ], isMarried : true } for ( const key in person ) { console . log ( key ) } Objects We declare object literal with const . // declaring object literal const person = { firstName : 'Asabeneh' , lastName : 'Yetayeh' , age : 250 , country : 'Finland' , city : 'Helsinki' , skills : [ 'HTML' , 'CSS' , 'JavaScript' , 'TypeScript' , 'React' , 'Node' , 'MongoDB' , 'Python' , 'D3.js' ], isMarried : true } // iterating through object keys for ( const key in person ) { console . log ( key , person [ key ]) } Conditional We say if, if else, if else if else, switch and ternary operators in previous challenges. // syntax if ( condition ) { // this part of code run for truthy condition } else { // this part of code run for false condition } // if else let num = 3 if ( num > 0 ) { console . log ( ` ${ num } is a positive number` ) } else { console . log ( ` ${ num } is a negative number` ) } // 3 is a positive number // if else if else if else let a = 0 if ( a > 0 ) { console . log ( ` ${ a } is a positive number` ) } else if ( a < 0 ) { console . log ( ` ${ a } is a negative number` ) } else if ( a == 0 ) { console . log ( ` ${ a } is zero` ) } else { console . log ( ` ${ a } is not a number` ) } // Switch More Examples let dayUserInput = prompt ( 'What day is today ?' ) let day = dayUserInput . toLowerCase () switch ( day ) { case 'monday' : console . log ( 'Today is Monday' ) break case 'tuesday' : console . log ( 'Today is Tuesday' ) break case 'wednesday' : console . log ( 'Today is Wednesday' ) break case 'thursday' : console . log ( 'Today is Thursday' ) break case 'friday' : console . log ( 'Today is Friday' ) break case 'saturday' : console . log ( 'Today is Saturday' ) break case 'sunday' : console . log ( 'Today is Sunday' ) break default : console . log ( 'It is not a week day.' ) } // ternary let isRaining = true isRaining ? console . log ( 'You need a rain coat.' ) : console . log ( 'No need for a rain coat.' ) Classes We declare class with CamelCase which starts with capital letter. // syntax class ClassName { // code goes here } // defining class class Person { constructor ( firstName , lastName ) { console . log ( this ) // Check the output from here this . firstName = firstName this . lastName = lastName } } Whatever style guide you follow be consistent. Follow some programming paradigms and design patterns. Remember, if you do not write you code in certain order or fashion it will be hard to read your code. So, do a favor for yourself or for someone who is going to read your code by writing readable code. \ud83c\udf15 You are tidy.

Every HTML element has a different properties which can help to manipulate it. It is possible to get, create, append or remove HTML elements using JavaScript. Check the examples below. Selecting HTML element using JavaScript is similar to selecting using CSS. To select an HTML element, we use tag name, id, class name or other attributes. Getting Element We can access already created element or elements using JavaScript. To access or get elements we use different methods. The code below has four h1 elements. Let us see the different methods to access the h1 elements. <!DOCTYPE html> < html lang = \"en\" > < head > < title > Document Object Model </ title > </ head > < body > < h1 class = 'title' id = 'first-title' > First Title </ h1 > < h1 class = 'title' id = 'second-title' > Second Title </ h1 > < h1 class = 'title' id = 'third-title' > Third Title </ h1 > < h1 ></ h1 > </ body > </ html > Getting elements by tag name getElementsByTagName() :takes a tag name as a string parameter and this method returns an HTMLCollection object. An HTMLCollection is an array like object of HTML elements. The length property provides the size of the collection. Whenever we use this method we access the individual elements using index or after loop through each individual items. An HTMLCollection does not support all array methods therefore we should use regular for loop instead of forEach. // syntax document . getElementsByTagName ( 'tagname' ) const allTitles = document . getElementsByTagName ( 'h1' ) console . log ( allTitles ) //HTMLCollections console . log ( allTitles . length ) // 4 for ( let i = 0 ; i < allTitles . length ; i ++ ) { console . log ( allTitles [ i ]) // prints each elements in the HTMLCollection } Getting elements by class name getElementsByClassName() method returns an HTMLCollection object. An HTMLCollection is an array like list of HTML elements. The length property provides the size of the collection. It is possible to loop through all the HTMLCollection elements. See the example below //syntax document . getElementsByClassName ( 'classname' ) const allTitles = document . getElementsByClassName ( 'title' ) console . log ( allTitles ) //HTMLCollections console . log ( allTitles . length ) // 4 for ( let i = 0 ; i < allTitles . length ; i ++ ) { console . log ( allTitles [ i ]) // prints each elements in the HTMLCollection } Getting an element by id getElementsById() targets a single HTML element. We pass the id without # as an argument. //syntax document . getElementById ( 'id' ) let firstTitle = document . getElementById ( 'first-title' ) console . log ( firstTitle ) // <h1>First Title</h1> Getting elements by using querySelector methods The document.querySelector method can select an HTML or HTML elements by tag name, by id or by class name. querySelector : can be used to select HTML element by its tag name, id or class. If the tag name is used it selects only the first element. let firstTitle = document . querySelector ( 'h1' ) // select the first available h1 element let firstTitle = document . querySelector ( '#first-title' ) // select id with first-title let firstTitle = document . querySelector ( '.title' ) // select the first available element with class title querySelectorAll : can be used to select html elements by its tag name or class. It returns a nodeList which is an array like object which supports array methods. We can use for loop or forEach to loop through each nodeList elements. const allTitles = document . querySelectorAll ( 'h1' ) # selects all the available h1 elements in the page console . log ( allTitles . length ) // 4 for ( let i = 0 ; i < allTitles . length ; i ++ ) { console . log ( allTitles [ i ]) } allTitles . forEach ( title => console . log ( title )) const allTitles = document . querySelectorAll ( '.title' ) // the same goes for selecting using class Adding attribute An attribute is added in the opening tag of HTML which gives additional information about the element. Common HTML attributes: id, class, src, style, href,disabled, title, alt. Lets add id and class for the fourth title. const titles = document . querySelectorAll ( 'h1' ) titles [ 3 ]. className = 'title' titles [ 3 ]. id = 'fourth-title' Adding attribute using setAttribute The setAttribute() method set any html attribute. It takes two parameters the type of the attribute and the name of the attribute. Let's add class and id attribute for the fourth title. const titles = document . querySelectorAll ( 'h1' ) titles [ 3 ]. setAttribute ( 'class' , 'title' ) titles [ 3 ]. setAttribute ( 'id' , 'fourth-title' ) Adding attribute without setAttribute We can use normal object setting method to set an attribute but this can not work for all elements. Some attributes are DOM object property and they can be set directly. For instance id and class //another way to setting an attribute titles [ 3 ]. className = 'title' titles [ 3 ]. id = 'fourth-title' Adding class using classList The class list method is a good method to append additional class. It does not override the original class if a class exists rather it adds additional class for the element. //another way to setting an attribute: append the class, doesn't over ride titles [ 3 ]. classList . add ( 'title' , 'header-title' ) Removing class using remove Similar to adding we can also remove class from an element. We can remove a specific class from an element. //another way to setting an attribute: append the class, doesn't over ride titles [ 3 ]. classList . remove ( 'title' , 'header-title' ) Adding Text to HTML element An HTML is a build block of an opening tag, a closing tag and a text content. We can add a text content using the property textContent or *innerHTML. Adding Text content using textContent The textContent property is used to add text to an HTML element. const titles = document . querySelectorAll ( 'h1' ) titles [ 3 ]. textContent = 'Fourth Title' Adding Text Content using innerHTML Most people get confused between textContent and innerHTML . textContent is meant to add text to an HTML element, however innerHTML can add a text or HTML element or elements as a child. Text Content We assign textContent HTML object property to a text const titles = document . querySelectorAll ( 'h1' ) titles [ 3 ]. textContent = 'Fourth Title' Inner HTML We use innerHTML property when we like to replace or a completely new children content to a parent element. It value we assign is going to be a string of HTML elements. <!DOCTYPE html> < html lang = \"en\" > < head > < title > JavaScript for Everyone:DOM </ title > </ head > < body > < div class = \"wrapper\" > < h1 > Asabeneh Yetayeh challenges in 2020 </ h1 > < h2 > 30DaysOfJavaScript Challenge </ h2 > < ul ></ ul > </ div > < script > const lists = ` <li>30DaysOfPython Challenge Done</li> <li>30DaysOfJavaScript Challenge Ongoing</li> <li>30DaysOfReact Challenge Coming</li> <li>30DaysOfFullStack Challenge Coming</li> <li>30DaysOfDataAnalysis Challenge Coming</li> <li>30DaysOfReactNative Challenge Coming</li> <li>30DaysOfMachineLearning Challenge Coming</li>` const ul = document . querySelector ( 'ul' ) ul . innerHTML = lists </ script > </ body > </ html > The innerHTML property can allow us also to remove all the children of a parent element. Instead of using removeChild() I would recommend the following method. <!DOCTYPE html> < html lang = \"en\" > < head > < title > JavaScript for Everyone:DOM </ title > </ head > < body > < div class = \"wrapper\" > < h1 > Asabeneh Yetayeh challenges in 2020 </ h1 > < h2 > 30DaysOfJavaScript Challenge </ h2 > < ul > < li > 30DaysOfPython Challenge Done </ li > < li > 30DaysOfJavaScript Challenge Ongoing </ li > < li > 30DaysOfReact Challenge Coming </ li > < li > 30DaysOfFullStack Challenge Coming </ li > < li > 30DaysOfDataAnalysis Challenge Coming </ li > < li > 30DaysOfReactNative Challenge Coming </ li > < li > 30DaysOfMachineLearning Challenge Coming </ li > </ ul > </ div > < script > const ul = document . querySelector ( 'ul' ) ul . innerHTML = '' </ script > </ body > </ html > Adding style Adding Style Color Let us add some style to our titles. If the element has even index we give it green color else red. const titles = document . querySelectorAll ( 'h1' ) titles . forEach (( title , i ) => { title . style . fontSize = '24px' // all titles will have 24px font size if ( i % 2 === 0 ) { title . style . color = 'green' } else { title . style . color = 'red' } }) Adding Style Background Color Let us add some style to our titles. If the element has even index we give it green color else red. const titles = document . querySelectorAll ( 'h1' ) titles . forEach (( title , i ) => { title . style . fontSize = '24px' // all titles will have 24px font size if ( i % 2 === 0 ) { title . style . backgroundColor = 'green' } else { title . style . backgroundColor = 'red' } }) Adding Style Font Size Let us add some style to our titles. If the element has even index we give it 20px else 30px const titles = document . querySelectorAll ( 'h1' ) titles . forEach (( title , i ) => { title . style . fontSize = '24px' // all titles will have 24px font size if ( i % 2 === 0 ) { title . style . fontSize = '20px' } else { title . style . fontSize = '30px' } }) As you have notice, the properties of css when we use it in JavaScript is going to be a camelCase. The following CSS properties change from background-color to backgroundColor, font-size to fontSize, font-family to fontFamily, margin-bottom to marginBottom. \ud83c\udf15 Now, you are fully charged with a super power, you have completed the most important and challenging part of the challenge and in general JavaScript.

We can add event listener method to any DOM object. We use addEventListener() method to listen different event types on HTML elements. The addEventListener() method takes two arguments, an event listener and a callback function. selectedElement . addEventListener ( 'eventlistner' , function ( e ) { // the activity you want to occur after the event will be in here }) // or selectedElement . addEventListener ( 'eventlistner' , e => { // the activity you want to occur after the event will be in here }) Click To attach an event listener to an element, first we select the element then we attach the addEventListener method. The event listener takes event type and callback functions as argument. The following is an example of click type event. Example: click <!DOCTYPE html> < html > < head > < title > Document Object Model </ title > </ head > < body > < button > Click Me </ button > < script > const button = document . querySelector ( 'button' ) button . addEventListener ( 'click' , e => { console . log ( 'e gives the event listener object:' , e ) console . log ( 'e.target gives the selected element: ' , e . target ) console . log ( 'e.target.textContent gives content of selected element: ' , e . target . textContent ) }) </ script > </ body > </ html > An event can be also attached directly to the HTML element as inline script. Example: onclick <!DOCTYPE html> < html > < head > < title > Document Object Model </ title > </ head > < body > < button onclick = \"clickMe()\" > Click Me </ button > < script > const clickMe = () => { alert ( 'We can attach event on HTML element' ) } </ script > </ body > </ html > Double Click To attach an event listener to an element, first we select the element then we attach the addEventListener method. The event listener takes event type and callback functions as argument. The following is an example of click type event. Example: dblclick <!DOCTYPE html> < html > < head > < title > Document Object Model </ title > </ head > < body > < button > Click Me </ button > < script > const button = document . querySelector ( 'button' ) button . addEventListener ( 'dblclick' , e => { console . log ( 'e gives the event listener object:' , e ) console . log ( 'e.target gives the selected element: ' , e . target ) console . log ( 'e.target.textContent gives content of selected element: ' , e . target . textContent ) }) </ script > </ body > </ html > Mouse enter To attach an event listener to an element, first we select the element then we attach the addEventListener method. The event listener takes event type and callback functions as argument. The following is an example of click type event. Example: mouseenter <!DOCTYPE html> < html > < head > < title > Document Object Model </ title > </ head > < body > < button > Click Me </ button > < script > const button = document . querySelector ( 'button' ) button . addEventListener ( 'mouseenter' , e => { console . log ( 'e gives the event listener object:' , e ) console . log ( 'e.target gives the selected element: ' , e . target ) console . log ( 'e.target.textContent gives content of selected element: ' , e . target . textContent ) }) </ script > </ body > </ html > By now you are familiar with addEventListen method and how to attach event listener. There are many types of event listeners. But in this challenge we will focus the most common important events. List of events: click - when the element clicked dblclick - when the element double clicked mouseenter - when the mouse point enter to the element mouseleave - when the mouse pointer leave the element mousemove - when the mouse pointer move on the element mouseover - when the mouse pointer move on the element mouseout -when the mouse pointer out from the element input -when value enter to input field change -when value change on input field blur -when the element is not focused keydown - when a key is down keyup - when a key is up keypress - when we press any key onload - when the browser has finished loading a page Test the above event types by replacing event type in the above snippet code. Getting value from an input element We usually fill forms and forms accept data. Form fields are created using input HTML element. Let us build a small application which allow us to calculate body mas index of a person using two input fields, one button and one p tag. input value <!DOCTYPE html> < html > < head > < title > Document Object Model:30 Days Of JavaScript </ title > </ head > < body > < h1 > Body Mass Index Calculator </ h1 > < input type = \"text\" id = \"mass\" placeholder = \"Mass in Kilogram\" /> < input type = \"text\" id = \"height\" placeholder = \"Height in meters\" /> < button > Calculate BMI </ button > < script > const mass = document . querySelector ( '#mass' ) const height = document . querySelector ( '#height' ) const button = document . querySelector ( 'button' ) let bmi button . addEventListener ( 'click' , () => { bmi = mass . value / height . value ** 2 alert ( `your bmi is ${ bmi . toFixed ( 2 ) } ` ) console . log ( bmi ) }) </ script > </ body > </ html > input event and change In the above example, we managed to get input values from two input fields by clicking button. How about if we want to get value without click the button. We can use the change or input event type to get data right away from the input field when the field is on focus. Let us see how we will handle that. <!DOCTYPE html> < html > < head > < title > Document Object Model:30 Days Of JavaScript </ title > </ head > < body > < h1 > Data Binding using input or change event </ h1 > < input type = \"text\" placeholder = \"say something\" /> < p ></ p > < script > const input = document . querySelector ( 'input' ) const p = document . querySelector ( 'p' ) input . addEventListener ( 'input' , e => { p . textContent = e . target . value }) </ script > </ body > </ html > blur event In contrast to input or change , the blur event occur when the input field is not on focus. <!
